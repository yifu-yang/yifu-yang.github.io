## 3. Show HN: OCR pipeline for ML training (tables, diagrams, math, multilingual)

ses425500000:Hi HN,<p>I’ve been working on an OCR pipeline specifically optimized for machine learning dataset preparation. It’s designed to process complex academic materials — including math formulas, tables, figures, and multilingual text — and output clean, structured formats like JSON and Markdown.<p>Some features:
 • Multi-stage OCR combining DocLayout-YOLO, Google Vision, MathPix, and Gemini Pro Vision
 • Extracts and understands diagrams, tables, LaTeX-style math, and multilingual text (Japanese&#x2F;Korean&#x2F;English)
 • Highly tuned for ML training pipelines, including dataset generation and preprocessing for RAG or fine-tuning tasks<p>Sample outputs and real exam-based examples are included (EJU Biology, UTokyo Math, etc.)
Would love to hear any feedback or ideas for improvement.<p>GitHub: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ses4255&#x2F;Versatile-OCR-Program">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ses4255&#x2F;Versatile-OCR-Program</a>

## 17. Show HN: Clawtype v2.1 – a one-hand chorded USB keyboard and mouse [video]

akavel:Written in Rust (embassy), running on a SparkFun ProMicro RP2040 board, with an MPU6050 gyroscope. Based on the Chordite idea from John W. McKown (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20220201061603&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chordite.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20220201061603&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;chordite.c...</a>). Intended for use with XR glasses I recently bought. Currently my typing speed is still rather slow, but my skill is graduably improving and at a noticeable pace, and I can and do some vim coding in my hobby time. I plan to try and do a wireless (BLE) version next, hopefully running off a single AA NiMH battery. The code is at: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;akavel&#x2F;clawtype">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;akavel&#x2F;clawtype</a>

## 25. Show HN: Corral – A Visual Logic Puzzle About Enclosing Numbers

MohammadAbuG:Hey HN!<p>I just finished building a puzzle game called Corral, and I’d love to share it with you.
It’s a logic puzzle played on a rectangular grid, where some of the cells contain numbers. Your goal is to mark which cells are inside a single continuous loop that encloses all the numbers.<p>For each numbered cell, the number tells you how many cells are visible in the four orthogonal directions (up, down, left, right) until a wall of the loop is hit, plus the cell itself. So a cell with a 2 must see one empty cell before hitting the loop boundary.
Gameplay is all about deduction: you can mark cells as definitely inside or definitely outside the loop. The loop must be one continuous shape, with no &quot;islands&quot; inside. Every puzzle has a solution and can be solved using pure logic.<p>There are three difficulty levels that you can choose from, enjoy!<p>Would love to hear your thoughts, ideas, or bug reports. Thanks for taking a look!
