## 6. Show HN: My AI Native Resume

jhgaylor:I&#x27;ve been deeply involved in working with AI agents and large language models (LLMs) for a while now. During a recent job search, I found myself repeatedly explaining my skills and experiences to various assistants. Around the same time, I was creating content for my website to help hiring teams understand my capabilities better and make informed decisions.<p>MCP had started to gain momentum and I saw a way to reduce my toil. So I built an MCP server that can effectively communicate my qualifications as a job candidate. This server acts as an AI-powered resume, providing an understanding of my professional background and a set of tools, prompts and resources to help explore my skills and experiences.<p>The code is open source, so you can create your own AI-driven resume server. Check it out here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jhgaylor&#x2F;node-candidate-mcp-server">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jhgaylor&#x2F;node-candidate-mcp-server</a>.<p>During my job search I paired my mcp server with others such as notion, hirebase, and gmail to build a leads database, write cover letters, and track my job search.

If you are okay with HTML, you might want to write an article using GitHub pages instead of any blogging platform (e.g. medium.com)
The only constrains then become your skills instead of what your chosen platform has decided to support (typically embedding videos, code snippets, ...)

## 30. Show HN: Driverless print server for legacy printers, profit goes to open-source

ValdikSS:This is a device, to which you connect your older USB printer, and use it from any PC or smartphone without installing drivers (AirPrint&#x2F;Mopria), wirelessly. As easy as that!<p><pre><code>  * Supports all OS: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android. No drivers needed. Windows-on-ARM and Apple M1&#x2F;2&#x2F;3&#x2F;4 also supported.
  * Supports the majority of printers released before ≈2018
  * Profit from sold devices is shared between CUPS, SANE, AirSane open-source printing and scanning projects
  * Surplus and donations are accumulated to improve current open-source drivers and develop new ones
</code></pre>
The printer driver is run inside the device. It comes with lots of open-source and official proprietary drivers. x86-only drivers are running under box86 emulation, with little visible performance impact, ensuring wide compatibility with many printers and MFPs.<p>All of this is bundled in a retail-like device, with simple web interface[1][2]. No tinkering and no DIY required, it&#x27;s safe to plug off the power cord every time, and you can do factory reset.<p>The print server is secure by default: it conforms to most of the IoT Device Security Specification 1.0[3] best practices, has built-in firewall to ensure LAN-only operation, and does not include anti-consumer features.<p>All devices come with technical support, where I act as a middleman between all the involved projects and printer drivers. If there&#x27;s a bug, I first try to debug the issue remotely, and if it&#x27;s not possible, end up buying the same printer and debug it until the issue is resolved.  
All the fixes made during the development are contributed back to the origin projects, and there were many bugs fixed: almost every package has additional patches compared to original Debian 12 disto state.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;printserver.ink&#x2F;webface-main.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;printserver.ink&#x2F;webface-main.png</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;printserver.ink&#x2F;webface-other.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;printserver.ink&#x2F;webface-other.png</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;csa-iot.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;23-80986-013-PSWG-1.0-Specification-18-March-2024.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;csa-iot.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2024&#x2F;03&#x2F;23-80986-013-...</a><p>P.S. Brother printer lovers, the latest Brother L2800dw (2024) laser comes with the chipped cartridge, which you can&#x27;t refill and reset forever anymore. The printer allows to continue printing with an &quot;empty&quot; cartridge with a special menu item, but it does so only to fixed amount of pages, and then stops. It doesn&#x27;t allow to use cartridges without chips.
