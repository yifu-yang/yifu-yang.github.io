## 1. Show HN: Goboscript, text-based programming language, compiles to Scratch

aspizu:goboscript is a text-based programming language which compiles to Scratch. It allows you to write Scratch projects in text, and compile it into a .sb3 file - which can be opened in the Scratch editor, TurboWarp or be uploaded to the Scratch website.<p>goboscript allows you to create advanced Scratch projects with ease, you can use any text editor, use a version control system such as git. You can refactor your code using search and replace. Text code can be copy pasted, which allows you to easily reuse code or share it with others. goboscript syntax is concise and easy to read.<p>goboscript allows you to integrate external tooling and workflows, such as using a script to generate costumes for a text rendering engine. Or loading in images into lists.<p>goboscript has a powerful macro system - similar to Rust&#x27;s macro system. This allows you to write macros to generate code.<p>goboscript is more than just an 1:1 mapping of Scratch blocks to text, it also has additional features like local variables for procedures (custom blocks).<p>goboscript also performs optimizations, detects problems and unused code.

## 3. Show HN: Sshsync – CLI tool to run shell commands across multiple remote servers

blackmamoth:I built a CLI tool called `sshsync` to run shell commands and transfer files across multiple servers over SSH concurrently.<p>It was inspired by tools like `pssh`, but I wanted something more modern, intuitive, and Pythonic.<p>What it does:<p>- Run shell commands on multiple servers (in parallel)
- Push&#x2F;pull files or directories with progress bars
- Uses `~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;config` and lets you group hosts with YAML
- Supports `--dry-run` mode to preview actions without executing
- Outputs results using `rich` (tables, colors)
- Built with `Typer`, `asyncssh`, and `rich`<p>There’s no daemon or extra setup, it reads your existing SSH config and just runs.<p>Would love feedback on general use and especially if there are ways to improve the `--dry-run` output.

## 9. Show HN: I modeled the Voynich Manuscript with SBERT to test for structure

brig90:I built this project as a way to learn more about NLP by applying it to something weird and unsolved.<p>The Voynich Manuscript is a 15th-century book written in an unknown script. No one’s been able to translate it, and many think it’s a hoax, a cipher, or a constructed language. I wasn’t trying to decode it — I just wanted to see: does it behave like a structured language?<p>I stripped a handful of common suffix-like endings (aiin, dy, etc.) to isolate what looked like root forms. I know that’s a strong assumption — I call it out directly in the repo — but it helped clarify the clustering. From there, I used SBERT embeddings and KMeans to group similar roots, inferred POS-like roles based on position and frequency, and built a Markov transition matrix to visualize cluster-to-cluster flow.<p>It’s not translation. It’s not decryption. It’s structural modeling — and it revealed some surprisingly consistent syntax across the manuscript, especially when broken out by section (Botanical, Biological, etc.).<p>GitHub repo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brianmg&#x2F;voynich-nlp-analysis">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;brianmg&#x2F;voynich-nlp-analysis</a>

## 11. Show HN: Job board aggregator for best paying remote SWE jobs in the U.S.

xitang:I’ve been a remote SWE since the pandemic and truly appreciate its flexibilities and time saved from not commuting. Lately, friends and close ones have been asking me for advice on finding remote roles. I shared my remote company spreadsheet with them, but realized it was a rather manual process to scroll and refresh each company’s career page for new postings.<p>So I put together a centralized job board aggregator that lists the best paying SWE jobs in one place, starting with the U.S. and 14 companies. The way it works is via a cron job that runs daily in the afternoon to pull the latest job postings from each company and updates the website with the new listings.<p>Some other key features are<p>1. Quickly see which companies are actively hiring, e.g. Coinbase currently has the most openings<p>2. Filter by years of experience or companies to find suitable matches<p>3. Easily see estimated salary and posted date<p>If you&#x27;re also on the hunt for the next remote SWE role, I hope this site helps streamline your job search and would appreciate any feedback and suggestions. Thanks!<p>Home page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.remoteswe.fyi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.remoteswe.fyi</a><p>FAQ page with additional context: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.remoteswe.fyi&#x2F;faq" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.remoteswe.fyi&#x2F;faq</a>

## 19. Show HN: I reinvented PHP in TypeScript (demo)

vseplet:I built Morph, an experimental fullstack HTML-first library for Deno, Node, and Bun.<p>Everything returns HTML, not JSON. No React, no Vite — just plain HTML with server-side rendering.<p>No build steps, no preprocessors, no complex configs — everything runs from a single file.<p>Perfect for Telegram Web Apps, internal tools, simple admin panels, dashboards, or anywhere a full-blown SPA feels like overkill.<p>Important: I built this entirely for myself — to solve my own problems.
I hate complex frontend. I hate writing it. And I don’t want to waste time on it.
But maybe it’ll help you too.

## 23. Show HN: Vaev – A browser engine built from scratch (It renders google.com)

monax:We’ve been working on Vaev, a minimal web browser engine built from scratch. It supports HTML&#x2F;XHTML, the CSS cascade, @page rules for pagination, and print-to-PDF rendering. It even handles calc(), var(), and percentage units—and yes, it renders Google.com (mostly).<p>This is an experimental project focused on learning and exploration. Networking is basic (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;</a> and file:&#x2F;&#x2F; only), and grid layouts aren’t supported yet, but we’re making progress fast.<p>We’d love your thoughts and feedback.

## 26. Show HN: Python Simulator of David Deutsch’s “Constructor Theory of Time”

SandroG:Hi HN,<p>I turned the freshly published paper “The Constructor Theory of Time” by David Deutsch and Chiara Marletto (arXiv, 13 May 2025) into an executable Python library.<p>What you’ll find
 • One-to-one translation of the paper’s formalism: Substrates, Attributes, Tasks, Constructors, and task-algebra operators
 • Possibility &#x2F; impossibility predicates and counterfactuals encoded exactly as defined
 • Test suite that mirrors every lemma and example (&gt;95 % coverage, mypy-typed)
 • Reproductions of key results: time-keeping substrates, irreversibility proofs, quantum branching tasks, and a self-replicating constructor<p>Why share?
Reading the paper is tough going; expressing each definition in code clarified the ideas and surfaced a couple of questions for discussion. Hoping it helps others and sparks extensions.<p>Looking for feedback:
 • Did I miss any subtleties in the formalism?
 • Which additional theorems or examples would you like implemented next?<p>Repo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gvelesandro&#x2F;constructor-theory-simulator">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gvelesandro&#x2F;constructor-theory-simulator</a><p>Thanks for taking a look—issues and PRs welcome!
