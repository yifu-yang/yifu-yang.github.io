## 6. Show HN: Fahmatrix – A Lightweight, Pandas-Like DataFrame Library for Java

mousomashakel:Hey HN, I’ve built Fahmatrix, a minimal, fast Java library for working with tabular data — inspired by Python’s pandas, but designed for performance and simplicity on the JVM.<p>After working extensively with Python’s data stack, I often ran into limitations related to speed, especially in larger or long-running data workflows. So I built Fahmatrix from scratch to offer similar APIs for manipulating CSVs, performing summary statistics, slicing rows&#x2F;columns, and more — but all in Java.<p>Features:<p>Lightweight and dependency-free<p>CSV&#x2F;TSV import with auto-headers<p>Series&#x2F;DataFrame structures (like pandas)<p>describe(), mean(), stdDev(), percentile() and more<p>Fast parallel operations on numeric columns<p>Java 17+ support<p>Docs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moustafa-nasr.github.io&#x2F;Fahmatrix&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moustafa-nasr.github.io&#x2F;Fahmatrix&#x2F;</a>
 GitHub: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;moustafa-nasr&#x2F;fahmatrix">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;moustafa-nasr&#x2F;fahmatrix</a><p>I’d love feedback from the Java and data communities — especially if you’ve ever wanted a simple dataframe utility in Java without needing full-scale ML libraries.<p>Happy to answer any questions!

## 13. Show HN: Merliot – plugging physical devices into LLMs

sfeldma:Merliot Hub is an AI-integrated device hub.<p>What does that mean? It means you can control and interact with your physical devices, your security cameras, your thermometer, seamlessly using natural language from an LLM host such as Claude Desktop or Cursor. The hub is a gateway between AI and the physical world.<p>What could go wrong?

## 15. Show HN: KVSplit – Run 2-3x longer contexts on Apple Silicon

dipampaul17:I discovered that in LLM inference, keys and values in the KV cache have very different quantization sensitivities. Keys need higher precision than values to maintain quality.<p>I patched llama.cpp to enable different bit-widths for keys vs. values on Apple Silicon. The results are surprising:<p>- K8V4 (8-bit keys, 4-bit values): 59% memory reduction with only 0.86% perplexity loss
- K4V8 (4-bit keys, 8-bit values): 59% memory reduction but 6.06% perplexity loss
- The configurations use the same number of bits, but K8V4 is 7× better for quality<p>This means you can run LLMs with 2-3× longer context on the same Mac. Memory usage scales with sequence length, so savings compound as context grows.<p>Implementation was straightforward: 
1. Added --kvq-key and --kvq-val flags to llama.cpp
2. Applied existing quantization logic separately to K and V tensors
3. Validated with perplexity metrics across context lengths
4. Used Metal for acceleration (with -mlong-calls flag to avoid vectorization issues)<p>Benchmarked on an M4 MacBook Pro running TinyLlama with 8K context windows. Compatible with Metal&#x2F;MPS and optimized for Apple Silicon.<p>GitHub: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dipampaul17&#x2F;KVSplit">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dipampaul17&#x2F;KVSplit</a>

## 17. I'm Peter Roberts, immigration attorney, who does work for YC and startups. AMA

proberts:I&#x27;ll be here for the next 5-6 hours. As usual, there are countless topics given the rapidly changing immigration landscape and I&#x27;ll be guided by whatever you&#x27;re concerned with. Please remember that I can&#x27;t provide legal advice on specific cases because I won&#x27;t have access to all the facts. Please stick to a factual discussion in your questions and I&#x27;ll try to do the same in my answers.<p>Edit: I am taking a break now and will return later this afternoon&#x2F;evening to respond to any comments and answer any questions. Thank you everyone for a great and engaged AMA so far.

## 19. Show HN: Visual flow-based programming for Erlang, inspired by Node-RED

Towaway69:Hi There,<p>Erlang-RED has been my project for the last couple of months and I would love to get some feedback from the HN community.<p>The idea is to take advantage of Erlangs message passing and low overhead processes to have true concurrency in Node-RED flows. Plus also to bring low-code visual flow-based programming to Erlang.
