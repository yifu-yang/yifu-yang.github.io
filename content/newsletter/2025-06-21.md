## 12. Show HN: A color name API that maps hex to the closest human-readable name

meodai:I built this API to return the closest named color for any hex value—using curated lists like my own [1], XKCD [2], and others.<p>I made it from scratch without Express or any frameworks because:<p>- I’m a frontend&#x2F;interaction dev and wanted to learn how to build an API from the ground up.
- Existing APIs didn’t guarantee unique names per color—mine does.
- It also supports WebSocket updates, gzip responses, and multiple name sets.<p>I’ve been collecting color names for over 10 years [1]. With ~30,000 entries, bundling them into every color-related project became excessive. This API keeps things lightweight—for me and hopefully for others too.<p>GitHub: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;meodai&#x2F;color-name-api">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;meodai&#x2F;color-name-api</a><p>Would love feedback on naming logic, accuracy, performance, or backend best practices I might’ve missed.<p>[1] Large Color Name List: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;meodai&#x2F;color-names">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;meodai&#x2F;color-names</a>

## 15. Show HN: Nxtscape – an open-source agentic browser

felarof:Hi HN - we&#x27;re Nithin and Nikhil, twin brothers and founders of nxtscape.ai (YC S24). We&#x27;re building Nxtscape (&quot;next-scape&quot;) - an open-source, agentic browser for the AI era.<p>-- Why bother building a new browser?
For the first time since Netscape was released in 1994, it feels like we can reimagine browsers from scratch for the age of AI agents. The web browser of tomorrow might not look like what we have today.<p>We saw how tools like Cursor gave developers a 10x productivity boost, yet the browser—where everyone else spends their entire workday—hasn&#x27;t fundamentally changed.<p>And honestly, we feel like we&#x27;re constantly fighting the browser we use every day. It&#x27;s not one big thing, but a series of small, constant frustrations. I&#x27;ll have 70+ tabs open from three different projects and completely lose my train of thought. And simple stuff like reordering tide pods from amazon or filling out forms shouldn&#x27;t need our full attention anymore. AI can handle all of this, and that&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re building.<p>Here’s a demo of our early version <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dub.sh&#x2F;nxtscape-demo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dub.sh&#x2F;nxtscape-demo</a><p>-- What makes us different
We know others are exploring this space (Perplexity, Dia), but we want to build something open-source and community-driven. We&#x27;re not a search or ads company, so we can focus on being privacy-first – Ollama integration, BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys), ad-blocker.<p>Btw we love what Brave started and stood for, but they&#x27;ve now spread themselves too thin across crypto, search, etc. We are laser-focused on one thing: making browsers work for YOU with AI. And unlike Arc (which we loved too but got abandoned), we&#x27;re 100% open source. Fork us if you don&#x27;t like our direction.<p>-- Our journey hacking a new browser
To build this, we had to fork Chromium. Honestly, it feels like the only viable path today—we&#x27;ve seen others like Brave (started with electron) and Microsoft Edge learn this the hard way.<p>We also started with why not just build an extension. But realized we needed more control. Similar to the reason why Cursor forked VSCode. For example, Chrome has this thing called the Accessibility Tree - basically a cleaner, semantic version of the DOM that screen readers use. Perfect for AI agents to understand pages, but you can&#x27;t use it through extension APIs.<p>That said, working with the 15M-line C++ chromium codebase has been an adventure. We&#x27;ve both worked on infra at Google and Meta, but Chromium is a different beast. Tools like Cursor&#x27;s indexing completely break at this scale, so we&#x27;ve had to get really good with grep and vim. And the build times are brutal—even with our maxed-out M4 Max MacBook, a full build takes about 3 hours.<p>Full disclosure: we are still very early, but we have a working prototype on GitHub. It includes an early version of a &quot;local Manus&quot; style agent that can automate simple web tasks, plus an AI sidebar for questions, and other productivity features (grouping tabs, saving&#x2F;resuming sessions, etc.).<p>Looking forward to any and all comments!<p>You can download the browser from our github page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nxtscape&#x2F;nxtscape">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nxtscape&#x2F;nxtscape</a>

## 21. Show HN: Inspect and extract files from MSI installers directly in your browser

rmast:Hey everyone!<p>I&#x27;m excited to share a small web app I built that allows you to view and extract the contents of Windows MSI installers directly in your browser. It&#x27;s essentially a web-based &quot;lessmsi&quot; powered by Pyodide.<p>You can try it out at: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pymsi.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;msi_viewer.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pymsi.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;msi_viewer.html</a><p>My motivation for building this was from part of my day job -- I often get Windows MSI installers and need to extract files while preserving the relative directory structure and filenames, as they would appear after a full installation. The existing tools I found were good but limited in which platforms they support: lessmsi works great on Windows, while msitools works for Linux&#x2F;macOS. Neither is a truly cross-platform solution that works on any major OS.<p>So we developed pymsi (a pure Python library, available on GitHub at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nightlark&#x2F;pymsi">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nightlark&#x2F;pymsi</a>) to handle reading and extracting MSI files from Python. Then I realized that since pymsi has no native dependencies, it could potentially run in a web browser using Pyodide. After a bit of &quot;vibe coding&quot; and fixing some &quot;hallucinated&quot; functions&#x2F;classes that don&#x27;t exist in pymsi, the result was this client-side web app.<p>If you need an MSI file to experiment with, older versions of PowerToys included the installer in .msi form, such as this one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;PowerToys&#x2F;releases&#x2F;download&#x2F;v0.21.1&#x2F;PowerToysSetup-0.21.1-x64.msi">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;microsoft&#x2F;PowerToys&#x2F;releases&#x2F;download&#x2F;v0....</a><p>Note that the underlying pymsi library hasn&#x27;t been extensively tested against a bunch of MSI installers yet, so there might still be lingering bugs. If you come across any issues, please don&#x27;t hesitate to report them in on the GitHub repository (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nightlark&#x2F;pymsi&#x2F;issues">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nightlark&#x2F;pymsi&#x2F;issues</a>).<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and answer any questions!
