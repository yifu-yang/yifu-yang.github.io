## 16. Show HN: MCP server for Blender that builds 3D scenes via natural language

prono:Hi HN!<p>I built a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects Blender to LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, and any other llm supporting tool calling and mcps, enabling the AI to understand and control 3D scenes using natural language.<p>You can describe an entire environment like:<p>&gt; “Create a small village with 5 huts arranged around a central bonfire, add a river flowing on the left, place a wooden bridge across it, and scatter trees randomly.”<p>And the system parses that, reasons about the scene, and builds it inside Blender — no manual modeling or scripting needed.<p>What it can do:
-  Generate multi-object scenes like villages, landscapes, from a single prompt
-  Understand spatial relations — e.g., “place the bridge over the river” or “add trees behind the huts”
-  Create camera animations and lighting setups: “orbit around the scene at sunset lighting”
-  Respond to iterative changes like: “replace all huts with stone houses” or “make the river narrower”
-  Maintain object hierarchy and labels for later editing<p>Tech Stack:
- Blender Python scripting
- Node.js server running MCP
- LLM backend (OpenAI &#x2F; Claude, easily swappable)<p>Demo:

Would you find this useful as a Blender plugin? I’m open to expanding it!<p>Please try it and give it a star on github

## 20. A Treatise for One Network – Anonymous National Deliberation [pdf]

simurgh_beau:Hi HN,<p>I am the author of this white paper, posting under the pseudonym Simurgh. Thank you for taking a look.<p>The Motivation: This project comes directly from my experience watching the &quot;Women, Life, Freedom&quot; movement in Iran and the subsequent efforts by the state to fragment and divide the opposition. I felt that if people could only talk to each other at scale and discover their common ground, they would be less susceptible to this strategy.<p>The Project: This white paper outlines a protocol for doing just that. It&#x27;s a structured, multi-stage deliberation system designed to be built on a platform with an existing network, like Telegram. It uses three core principles:<p><pre><code>    Absolute Anonymity: To protect participants.

    Structured Process: A tiered funnel to distill signal from noise.

    Meritocratic Promotion: To ensure the most well-reasoned ideas rise to the top.
</code></pre>
The full architecture, including mitigations for risks like state-level manipulation, Sybil attacks, and bad actors, is detailed in the paper.<p>My Ask of the HN Community: I am not a cryptographer or a large-scale systems architect. I am posting this here because this community has an incredible depth of expertise. I am looking for your honest feedback, especially on:<p><pre><code>    Potential failure modes and security vulnerabilities in the protocol design.

    Suggestions for strengthening the system against manipulation.

    Any thoughts on the overall concept from those who have experience building social or secure messaging protocols.
</code></pre>
I am here to listen and answer any questions you may have. Thank you for your time and consideration.
