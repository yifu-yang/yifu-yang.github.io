## 2. Launch HN: Exa (YC S21) – The web as a database

willbryk:Hey HN! We’re Will and Jeff from Exa (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exa.ai</a>). We recently launched Exa Websets, an embeddings-powered search engine designed to return exactly what you’re asking for. You can get precise results for complex queries like “all startups working on open-source developer tools based in SF, founded 2021-2025”. 
Demo here - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Unt8hJmCxd4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Unt8hJmCxd4</a><p>We started working on Exa because we were frustrated that while LLM state-of-the-art is advancing every week, Google has gotten worse over time. The Internet used to feel like a magical information portal, but it doesn’t feel that way anymore when you’re constantly being pushed towards SEO-optimized clickbait.<p>Websets is a step in the opposite direction. For every search, we perform dozens of embedding searches over Exa’s vector database of the web to find good search candidates, then we run agentic workflows on each result to verify they match exactly what you asked for.<p>Websets results are good for two reasons. First, we train custom embedding models for our main search algorithm, instead of typical keyword matching search algorithms. Our embeddings models are trained specifically to return exactly the type of entity you ask for. In practice, that means if you search “startups working in nanotech”, keyword-based search engines return listicles about nanotech startups, because these listicles match the keywords in the query. In contrast, our embedding models return actual startup homepages, because these startup homepages match the meaning of the query.<p>The second is that LLMs provide the last-mile intelligence needed to verify every result. Each result and piece of data is backed with supporting references that we used to validate that the result is actually a match for your search criteria. That’s why Websets can take minutes or even hours to run, depending on your query and how many results you ask for. For valuable search queries, we think this is worth it.<p>Also notably, Websets are tables, not lists. You can add “enrichment” columns to find more information about each result, like “# of employees” or “does author have blog?”, and the cells asynchronously load in. This table format hopefully makes the web feel more like a database.<p>A few examples of searches that work with Websets:<p>- “Math blogs created by teachers from outside the US”: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;cma1oz9xf007sis0ipzxgbamn">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;cma1oz9xf007sis0ipzxgbamn</a><p>- &quot;research paper about ways to avoid the O(n^2) attention problem in transformers, where one of the first author&#x27;s first name starts with &quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, or &quot;T&quot;, and it was written between 2018 and 2022”: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;cm7dpml8c001ylnymum4sp11h">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;cm7dpml8c001ylnymum4sp11h</a><p>- “US based healthcare companies, with over 100 employees and a technical founder&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;cm6lc0dlk004ilecmzej76qx2">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;cm6lc0dlk004ilecmzej76qx2</a><p>- “all software engineers in the Bay Area, with experience in startups, who know Rust and have published technical content before”: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;knjrlm1aibQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;knjrlm1aibQ</a><p>You can try it at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;websets.exa.ai&#x2F;</a> and API docs are at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.exa.ai&#x2F;websets">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.exa.ai&#x2F;websets</a>.

## 29. Show HN: Plexe – ML Models from a Prompt

vaibhavdubey97:Hey HN! We’re Vaibhav and Marcello. We’re building Plexe (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plexe-ai&#x2F;plexe">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plexe-ai&#x2F;plexe</a>), an open-source agent that turns natural language task descriptions into trained ML models. Here’s a video walkthrough: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bUwCSglhcXY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bUwCSglhcXY</a>.<p>There are all kinds of uses for ML models that never get realized because the process of making them is messy and convoluted. You can spend months trying to find the data, clean it, experiment with models and deploy to production, only to find out that your project has been binned for taking so long. There are many tools for “automating” ML, but it still takes teams of ML experts to actually productionize something of value. And we can’t keep throwing LLMs at every ML problem. Why use a generic 10B parameter language model, if a logistic regression trained on your data could do the job better?<p>Our light-bulb moment was that we could use LLMs to generate task-specific ML models that would be trained on one’s own data. Thanks to the emergent reasoning ability of LLMs, it is now possible to create an agentic system that might automate most of the ML lifecycle.<p>A couple of months ago, we started developing a Python library that would let you define ML models on structured data using a description of the expected behaviour. Our initial implementation arranged potential solutions into a graph, using LLMs to write plans, implement them as code, and run the resulting training script. Using simple search algorithms, the system traversed the solution space to identify and package the best model.<p>However, we ran into several limitations, as the algorithm proved brittle under edge cases, and we kept having to put patches for every minor issue in the training process. We decided to rethink the approach, throw everything out, and rebuild the tool using an agentic approach prioritising generality and flexibility. What started as a single ML engineering agent turned into an agentic ML &quot;team&quot;, with all experiments tracked and logged using MLFlow.<p>Our current implementation uses the smolagents library to define an agent hierarchy. We mapped the functionality of our previous implementation to a set of specialized agents, such as an “ML scientist” that proposes solution plans, and so on. Each agent has specialized tools, instructions, and prompt templates. To facilitate cross-agent communication, we implemented a shared memory that enables objects (datasets, code snippets, etc) to be passed across agents indirectly by referencing keys in a registry. You can find a detailed write-up on how it works here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plexe-ai&#x2F;plexe&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;architecture&#x2F;multi-agent-system.md">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plexe-ai&#x2F;plexe&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;architectur...</a><p>Plexe’s early release is focused on predictive problems over structured data, and can be used to build models such as forecasting player injury risk in high-intensity sports, product recommendations for an e-commerce marketplace, or predicting technical indicators for algorithmic trading. Here are some examples to get you started: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plexe-ai&#x2F;plexe&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;examples">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;plexe-ai&#x2F;plexe&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;examples</a><p>To get it working on your data, you can dump any CSV, parquet, etc and Plexe uses what it needs from your dataset to figure out what features it should use. In the open-source tool, it only supports adding files right now but in our platform version, we&#x27;ll have support for integrating with Postgres where it pulls all available data based on an SQL query and dumps it into a parquet file for the agent to build models.<p>Next up, we’ll be tackling more of the ML project lifecycle: we’re currently working on adding a “feature engineering agent” that focuses on the complex data transformations that are often required for data to be ready for model training. If you&#x27;re interested, check Plexe out and let us know your thoughts!
