## 11. Show HN: HelixDB – Open-source vector-graph database for AI applications (Rust)

GeorgeCurtis:Hey HN, we want to share HelixDB (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HelixDB&#x2F;helix-db&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HelixDB&#x2F;helix-db&#x2F;</a>), a project a college friend and I are working on. It’s a new database that natively intertwines graph and vector types, without sacrificing performance. It’s written in Rust and our initial focus is on supporting RAG. Here’s a video runthrough: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;screen.studio&#x2F;share&#x2F;szgQu3yq" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;screen.studio&#x2F;share&#x2F;szgQu3yq</a>.<p>Why a hybrid? Vector databases are useful for similarity queries, while graph databases are useful for relationship queries. Each stores data in a way that’s best for its main type of query (e.g. key-value stores vs. node-and-edge tables). However, many AI-driven applications need <i>both</i> similarity and relationship queries. For example, you might use vector-based semantic search to retrieve relevant legal documents, and then use graph traversal to identify relationships between cases.<p>Developers of such apps have the quandary of needing to build on top of two different databases—a vector one and a graph one—plus you have to link them together and sync the data. Even then, your two databases aren&#x27;t designed to work together—for example, there’s no native way to perform joins or queries that span both systems. You’ll need to handle that logic at the application level.<p>Helix started when we realized that there are ways to integrate vector and graph data that are both fast and suitable for AI applications, especially RAG-based ones. See this cool research paper: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;2408.04948v1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;2408.04948v1</a>. After reading that and some other papers on graph and hybrid RAG, we decided to build a hybrid DB. Our aim was to make something better to use from a developer standpoint, while also making it fast as hell.<p>After a few months of working on this as a side project, our benchmarking shows that we are on par with Pinecone and Qdrant for vectors, and our graph is up to three orders of magnitude faster than Neo4j.<p>Problems where a hybrid approach works particularly well include:<p>- Indexing codebases: you can vectorize code-snippets within a function (connected by edges) based on context and then create an AST (in a graph) from function calls, imports, dependencies, etc. Agents can look up code by similarity or keyword and then traverse the AST to get only the relevant code, which reduces hallucinations and prevents the LLM from guessing object shapes or variable&#x2F;function names.<p>- Molecule discovery: Model biological interactions (e.g., proteins → genes → diseases) using graph types and then embed molecule structures to find similar compounds or case studies.<p>- Enterprise knowledge management: you can represent organisational structure, projects, and people (e.g., employee → team → project) in graph form, then index internal documents, emails, or notes as vectors for semantic search and link them directly employees&#x2F;teams&#x2F;projects in the graph.<p>I naively assumed when learning about databases for the first time that queries would be compiled and executed like functions in traditional programming. Turns out I was wrong, but this creates unnecessary latency by sending extra data (the whole written query), compiling it at run time, and then executing it. With Helix, you write the queries in our query language (HelixQL), which is then transpiled into Rust code and built directly into the database server, where you can call a generated API endpoint.<p>Many people have a thing against “yet another query language” (doubtless for good reason!) but we went ahead and did it anyway, because we think it makes working with our database so much easier that it’s worth a bit of a learning curve. HelixQL takes from other query languages such as Gremlin, Cypher and SQL with some extra ideas added in. It is declarative while the traversals themselves are functional. This allows complete control over the traversal flow while also having a cleaner syntax. HelixQL returns JSON to make things easy for clients. Also, it uses a schema, so the queries are type-checked.<p>We took a crude approach to building the original graph engine as a way to get an MVP out, so we are now working on improving the graph engine by making traversals massively parallel and pipelined. This means data is only ever decoded from disk when it is needed, and parts of reads are all processed in parallel.<p>If you’d like to try it out in a simple RAG demo, you can follow this guide and run our Jupyter notebook: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HelixDB&#x2F;helix-db&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;examples&#x2F;rag_demo">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;HelixDB&#x2F;helix-db&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;examples&#x2F;rag_d...</a><p>Many thanks! Comments and feedback welcome!

## 13. Launch HN: Miyagi (YC W25) turns YouTube videos into online, interactive courses

bestwillcui:Hey HN, we’re Tyrone and Guang, founders of Miyagi Labs (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;miyagilabs.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;miyagilabs.ai</a>), an AI-powered education platform that transforms educational YouTube videos into interactive courses. It helps you learn better through active practice and personalized feedback.<p>We use LLMs to automatically generate quizzes, practice questions, and real-time feedback from any educational video or resource—turning passive watching into active learning. Here’s a short demo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;alO7FaorHOY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;alO7FaorHOY</a>.<p>Improving education has always been tricky. Bloom’s 2-sigma problem (showing that a high-quality personal tutor is far more effective than conventional methods) has persisted, even as technology has advanced.<p>We met at MIT as CS majors and have always been passionate about education. Over the years, we’ve become teachers and experts in subjects like chess, algorithms, math, languages, and ninja warrior. A common theme was that we both heavily relied on YouTube to learn.<p>YouTube has incredible content for learning pretty much anything, but it’s buried in a lot of distractions. Also, passively watching videos is far less effective than taking notes, asking questions, and doing practice problems, which is what we aim to do with Miyagi Labs.<p>Our solution is essentially a multi-step function that takes in a YouTube playlist (or list of any resources) and outputs an entire course with summaries, questions, answers, and more. The pipeline is roughly: video&#x2F;resource —&gt; transcript&#x2F;text —&gt; chunks —&gt; summary and question —&gt; answers to questions, with some other features along the way.<p>We mostly use prompting and different models at each step to make the course as useful as possible. Certain topics require more practice problems vs. comprehension, and we’d use reasoning models for highly technical subjects.<p>We launched about three months ago and currently have 400+ courses and partnerships with some businesses and awesome creators. Some of our popular courses include 3Blue1Brown’s linear algebra course, a botany course on plants and ecology, and YC’s How to Start a Startup series.<p>Our product resembles classical MOOC-style course platforms in terms of UI, but is more interactive. It’s really easy to ask a question or receive custom feedback compared to a static course on Coursera. It’s also comparable to AI tutor sites, but we try to build more of a community and require less activation energy as a learner. We’re basically betting that AI can hugely improve education, but that students still want to learn from their favorite creators and want baseline shared resources for standard topics that are then augmented with personalized features.<p>You can try it here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;miyagilabs.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;miyagilabs.ai</a> (no login required for most courses—but if you sign up you can also create your own course).<p>We’d love your feedback on what kinds of videos&#x2F;resources you’d like to learn from, what’s missing from current learning tools, and if you know any creators or educators who would like to collaborate. Happy to hear any feedback and answer any questions!
