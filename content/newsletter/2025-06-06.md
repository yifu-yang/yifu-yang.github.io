## 11. Air Lab – A portable and open air quality measuring device

256dpi:Hi HN!<p>I’ve been working on an air quality measuring device called Air Lab for the past three years. It measures CO2, temperature, relative humidity, air pollutants (VOC, NOx), and atmospheric pressure. You can log and analyze the data directly on the device — no smartphone or laptop needed.<p>To better show what the device can do and how it feels like, I spent the past week developing a web-based simulator using Emscripten. It runs the stock firmware with most features available except for networking. Check it out and let me know what you think!<p>The firmware will be open-source and available once the first batch of devices ships. We’re currently finishing up our crowdfunding campaign on CrowdSupply. If you want to get one, now is the time to support the project: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crowdsupply.com&#x2F;networked-artifacts&#x2F;air-lab" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crowdsupply.com&#x2F;networked-artifacts&#x2F;air-lab</a><p>We started building the Air Lab because most air quality measuring devices we found were locked-down or hard to tinker with. Air quality is a growing concern, and we’re hoping a more open, playful approach can help make the topic more accessible. It is important to us that there is a low bar for customizing and extending the Air Lab. Until we ship, we plan to create rich documentation and further tools, like the simulator, to make this as easy as possible.<p>The technical: The device is powered by the popular ESP32S3 microcontroller, equipped with a precise CO2, temperature, and relative humidity sensor (SCD41) as well as a VOC&#x2F;NOx (SGP41) and atmospheric pressure sensor (LPS22). The support circuitry provides built-in battery charging, a real-time clock, an RGB LED, buzzer, an accelerometer, and capacitive touch, which makes Air Lab a powerful stand-alone device. The firmware itself is written on top of esp-idf and uses LVGL for rendering the UI.<p>If you seek more high-level info, here are also some videos covering the project:

If you want to get notified on project updates, subscribe on Crowd Supply.<p>Happy to answer any questions!

## 13. Show HN: Ask-human-mcp – zero-config human-in-loop hatch to stop hallucinations

echollama:While building my startup i kept running into the issue where ai agents in cursor create endpoints or code that shouldn&#x27;t exist, hallucinates strings, or just don&#x27;t understand the code.<p>ask-human-mcp pauses your agent whenever it’s stuck, logs a question into ask_human.md in your root directory with answer: PENDING, and then resumes as soon as you fill in the correct answer.<p>the pain:<p>your agent screams out an endpoint that never existed
it makes confident assumptions and you spend hours debugging false leads<p>the fix:<p>ask-human-mcp gives your agent an escape hatch. when it’s unsure, it calls ask_human(), writes a question into ask_human.md, and waits. you swap answer: PENDING for the real answer and it keeps going.<p>some features:<p>- zero config: pip install ask-human-mcp + one line in .cursor&#x2F;mcp.json → boom, you’re live
- cross-platform: works on macOS, Linux, and Windows—no extra servers or webhooks.
- markdown Q\&amp;A: agent calls await ask_human(), question lands in ask_human.md with answer: PENDING. you write the answer, agent picks back up
- file locking &amp; rotation: prevents corrupt files, limits pending questions, auto-rotates when ask_human.md hits ~50 MB<p>the quickstart<p>pip install ask-human-mcp
ask-human-mcp --help<p>add to .cursor&#x2F;mcp.json and restart:
{
  &quot;mcpServers&quot;: {
    &quot;ask-human&quot;: { &quot;command&quot;: &quot;ask-human-mcp&quot; }
  }
}<p>now any call like:<p>answer = await ask_human(
  &quot;which auth endpoint do we use?&quot;,
  &quot;building login form in auth.js&quot;
)<p>creates:<p>### Q8c4f1e2a
ts: 2025-01-15 14:30
q: which auth endpoint do we use?
ctx: building login form in auth.js
answer: PENDING<p>just replace answer: PENDING with the real endpoint (e.g., `POST &#x2F;api&#x2F;v2&#x2F;auth&#x2F;login`) and your agent continues.<p>link:<p>github -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Masony817&#x2F;ask-human-mcp">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Masony817&#x2F;ask-human-mcp</a><p>feedback:<p>I&#x27;m Mason a 19yo solo-founder at Kallro. Happy to hear any bugs, feature requests, or weird edge cases you uncover - drop a comment or open an issue!

## 20. Show HN: Lambduck, a Functional Programming Brainfuck

jorkingit:What if Brainfuck was less like C and more like Scheme?<p>The interpreter implemetation is pretty bad. It&#x27;s not very fast, it&#x27;s not very good, and it&#x27;s probably not very correct. But maybe there&#x27;s some vaguely interesting programs you could write with it!<p>For example, the Y combinator:<p><pre><code>  λf. (λx. f (x x)) (λx. f (x x))
</code></pre>
is written as:<p><pre><code>  \` \`1 `0 0 \`1 `0 0</code></pre>

## 26. Show HN: iOS Screen Time from a REST API

anteloper:We&#x27;re Oliver and Royce and we&#x27;re the founders of Clearspace. We build tools to help people reduce their screen time (here’s us two years ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35888644">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35888644</a>)<p>We get all kinds of requests from users for ways they&#x27;d like to use their screen time data.<p>- “Auto-donate $x to charity every time I exceed a limit or try to bypass it”<p>- “My 75 Hard group has a screen time requirement, can we set up group visibility?”<p>- “Let my personal agent know if it’s a good time to tackle things on my todo list”<p>- “Auto-report large deviations in my screen time to my therapist “<p>We aren&#x27;t able to build for all of them, so we&#x27;re releasing this API.<p>This is the first time iOS Screen Time is accessible on the web. Apple doesn’t expose it, but since we measure it ourselves, we can - via UI or API. We&#x27;re launching this API so developers can build all these tools and more. Our goal is to enable more solutions to what we believe is the biggest problem in the world - the misalignment of human attention and intention in the digital world.<p>Here&#x27;s a quick demo of setting up and using the API: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1QahETj3xaaIsn0JiNbuqvTaSLdxo-eTu&#x2F;view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1QahETj3xaaIsn0JiNbuqvTaSLdx...</a>

crlapples:Hi, I&#x27;m currently homeless but I know how to create fully loaded full stack websites. I cant remember everything off the top of my head, but I can remember most of it. I started coding in 2011 until 2012 with mostly HTML, CSS and javascript. then I just started again in 2024 until now with react, next.js, typescript, tailwind, Shopify and wordpress. I&#x27;m here because its free to post and I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s someone out there who is willing to hire someone like me. Thoughts are appreciated.
