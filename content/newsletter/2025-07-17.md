## 12. Show HN: A 'Choose Your Own Adventure' written in Emacs Org Mode

dskhatri:I authored and developed an interactive children&#x27;s book about entrepreneurship and money management. The journey started with Twinery, the open-source tool for making interactive fiction, discovered right here on HN. The tool kindled memories of reading CYOA style books when I was a kid, and I thought the format would be awesome for writing a story my kids could follow along, incorporating play money to learn about transactions as they occurred in the story.<p>Twinery is a fantastic tool, and I used it to layout the story map. I really wanted to write the content of the story in Emacs and Org Mode however. Thankfully, Twinery provided the ability to write custom Story Formats that defined how a story was exported. I wrote a Story Format called Twiorg that would export the Twinery file to an Org file and then a Org export backend (ox-twee) to do the reverse. With these tools, I could go back and forth between Emacs and Twinery for authoring the story.<p>The project snowballed and I ended up with the book in digital and physical book formats. The Web Book is created using another Org export backend.<p>Ten Dollar Adventure: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tendollaradventure.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tendollaradventure.com</a><p>Sample the Web Book (one complete storyline&#x2F;adventure): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tendollaradventure.com&#x2F;sample&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tendollaradventure.com&#x2F;sample&#x2F;</a><p>I couldn&#x27;t muster the effort to write a special org export backend for the physical books unfortunately and used a commercial editor to format these.<p>Twiorg: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danishec&#x2F;twiorg">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danishec&#x2F;twiorg</a><p>ox-twee: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danishec&#x2F;ox-twee">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;danishec&#x2F;ox-twee</a><p>Previous HN post on writing the transaction logic using an LLM in Emacs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.tendollaradventure.com&#x2F;automating-story-logic-with-llms&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.tendollaradventure.com&#x2F;automating-story-logic-w...</a><p>Twinery 2: &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twinery.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twinery.org&#x2F;</a>&gt; and discussion on HN: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32788965">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32788965</a>

## 19. Show HN: Improving search ranking with chess Elo scores

ghita_:Hello HN,<p>I&#x27;m Ghita, co-founder of ZeroEntropy (YC W25). We build high accuracy search infrastructure for RAG and AI Agents.<p>We just released two new state-of-the-art rerankers zerank-1, and zerank-1-small. One of them is fully open-source under Apache 2.0.<p>We trained those models using a novel Elo score inspired pipeline which we describe in detail in the blog attached. In a nutshell, here is an outline of the training steps:
* Collect soft preferences between pairs of documents using an ensemble of LLMs.
* Fit an ELO-style rating system (Bradley-Terry) to turn pairwise comparisons into absolute per-document scores.
* Normalize relevance scores across queries using a bias correction step, modeled using cross-query comparisons and solved with MLE.<p>You can try the models either through our API (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.zeroentropy.dev&#x2F;models">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.zeroentropy.dev&#x2F;models</a>), or via HuggingFace (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;zeroentropy&#x2F;zerank-1-small" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;zeroentropy&#x2F;zerank-1-small</a>).<p>We would love this community&#x27;s feedback on the models, and the training approach. A full technical report is also going to be released soon.<p>Thank you!

## 20. How and where will agents ship software?

stopachka:The linked article explains this in detail, but today we&#x27;re releasing:<p>1. An API to spin up apps programmatically. This is great if you are building platforms, where you can spin up databases and backends with 0 additional compute<p>2. An MCP server, which lets you and your agents talk to Instant and create apps<p>3. Agent rules, which tell agents how to use Instant<p>If you want to try this yourself, we have a tutorial that lets you run Instant in your own workflow: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instantdb.com&#x2F;tutorial">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instantdb.com&#x2F;tutorial</a>.
