## 12. Show HN: Use Their ID – Use your local UK MP’s ID for the Online Safety Act

timje1:Hi HN - 
I made a site that takes a UK postcode, grabs the local MP&#x27;s information and generates an AI mockup of what their ID might look like.<p>It&#x27;s a small, silly protest at the stupidity of the Online Safety Act that just came into force.<p>edit - My open AI credits got hugged to death, please use a known postcode (like one from Kier Starmer&#x27;s constituency, WC2B6NH) in the meantime.

## 13. Claude Code weekly rate limits

thebestmoshe:Hi there,<p>Next month, we&#x27;re introducing new weekly rate limits for Claude subscribers, affecting less than 5% of users based on current usage patterns.<p>Claude Code, especially as part of our subscription bundle, has seen unprecedented growth. At the same time, we’ve identified policy violations like account sharing and reselling access—and advanced usage patterns like running Claude 24&#x2F;7 in the background—that are impacting system capacity for all. Our new rate limits address these issues and provide a more equitable experience for all users.<p>What’s changing:
Starting August 28, we&#x27;re introducing weekly usage limits alongside our existing 5-hour limits:
Current: Usage limit that resets every 5 hours (no change)
New: Overall weekly limit that resets every 7 days
New: Claude Opus 4 weekly limit that resets every 7 days
As we learn more about how developers use Claude Code, we may adjust usage limits to better serve our community. 
What this means for you:
Most users won&#x27;t notice any difference. The weekly limits are designed to support typical daily use across your projects. 
Most Max 5x users can expect 140-280 hours of Sonnet 4 and 15-35 hours of Opus 4 within their weekly rate limits. Heavy Opus users with large codebases or those running multiple Claude Code instances in parallel will hit their limits sooner.
You can manage or cancel your subscription anytime in Settings.
We take these decisions seriously. We&#x27;re committed to supporting long-running use cases through other options in the future, but until then, weekly limits will help us maintain reliable service for everyone.<p>We also recognize that during this same period, users have encountered several reliability and performance issues. We&#x27;ve been working to fix these as quickly as possible, and will continue addressing any remaining issues over the coming days and weeks.<p>–The Anthropic Team

## 19. Show HN: Companies use AI to take your calls. I built AI to make them for you

michaelphi:We&#x27;re living in this weird asymmetry where companies use AI to talk to us, but we&#x27;re still manually dialing them. Companies everywhere are adopting AI voice agents lately. Big retail, family dentist clinics, local pharmacy. This year, I&#x27;ve been in a few calls where it&#x27;s super natural sounding AI, which has been pretty cool to experience. But then it got me thinking - why are we, the consumers, still the ones making calls if they&#x27;re using robots for theirs?<p>So I built Piper: basically AI that makes phone calls for you. You tell it what you need (book appointment, check on an order, dispute some charge, whatever), and it handles the entire conversation while you do actual work. Right now it&#x27;s a web app, Chrome extension is pending approval but soon you&#x27;ll be able to click any phone number anywhere and just let Piper handle it.<p>Technical stuff that was harder than expected:<p>Latency - every millisecond counts in conversation, had to optimize around kv cache, got it down to ~1000ms to first word over PSTN for telephony, which feels pretty natural<p>Keeping the voice agents on track - built custom context engineering logic that constantly updates the agent&#x27;s situational awareness, so it knows when it&#x27;s been transferred, when it&#x27;s on hold, etc<p>Done ~50 successful calls with early testers so far. Main failures are when they need complex verification or documents. Also had to take down our IVR navigation temporarily :&#x2F;, found some edge cases that were causing unnecessary transfers but working on fixing that.<p>I really think we&#x27;re heading toward this world where AI talks to AI for most routine things, and phone calls might be the first real example of this happening at scale!<p>you can check out the a voice demo on our website. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pipervoice.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pipervoice.com</a>
