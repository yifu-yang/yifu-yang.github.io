## 13. Show HN: Beatsync – perfect audio sync across multiple devices

freemanjiang:Hi HN! I made Beatsync, an open-source browser-based audio player that syncs audio with millisecond-level accuracy across many devices.<p>Try it live right now: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.beatsync.gg&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.beatsync.gg&#x2F;</a><p>The idea is that with no additional hardware, you can turn any group of devices into a full surround sound system. MacBook speakers are particularly good.<p>Inspired by Network Time Protocol (NTP), I do clock synchronization over websockets and use the Web Audio API to keep audio latency under a few ms.<p>You can also drag devices around a virtual grid to simulate spatial audio — it changes the volume of each device depending on its distance to a virtual listening source!<p>I&#x27;ve been working on this project for the past couple of weeks. Would love to hear your thoughts and ideas!

## 19. Show HN: A Chrome extension that will auto-reject non-essential cookies

mitch292:A FOSS chrome extension that attempts to remove the annoyance of cookie pop ups and banners.<p>There are some extensions out there that auto-accept cookies, but I didn&#x27;t find one that auto rejected cookies without either chaining some extensions together or setting up custom rules in tools like uBlock origin. So with this extension, you just need to add it for non-essential cookies to be rejected.<p>Github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mitch292&#x2F;reject-cookies">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mitch292&#x2F;reject-cookies</a>

I want it to keep improving and working on more and more sites. Feedback welcome. Thanks!

## 20. Show HN: An MCP server for understanding AWS costs

StratusBen:Hey all - I work at Vantage, a FinOps platform.<p>I know AI is peak hype right now. But it has definitely changed some of our dev workflows already. So we wanted to find a way to let our customers experiment with how they can use AI to make their cloud cost management work more productive.<p>The MCP Server acts as a connector between LLMs (right now only Claude, Cursor support it but ChatGPT and Google Gemini coming soon) and your cost and usage data on Vantage which supports 20+ cloud infra providers including AWS, Datadog, Mongo, etc. (You have to have a Vantage account to use it since it&#x27;s using the Vantage API)<p>Video demo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=n0VP2NlUvRU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=n0VP2NlUvRU</a><p>Repo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vantage-sh&#x2F;vantage-mcp-server">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vantage-sh&#x2F;vantage-mcp-server</a><p>It&#x27;s really impressive how capable the latest-gen models are with an MCP server and an API. So far we have found it useful for:<p>Ad-Hoc questions: &quot;What&#x27;s our non-prod cloud spend per engineer if we have 25 engineers&quot;<p>Action plans: &quot;Find unallocated spend and look for clues how it should be tagged&quot;<p>Multi-tool workflows: &quot;Find recent cost spikes that look like they could have come from eng changes and look for GitHub PR&#x27;s merged around the same time&quot; (using it in combination with the GitHub MCP)<p>Thought I&#x27;d share, let me know if you have questions.

## 24. Show HN: AgenticSeek – Self-hosted alternative to cloud-based AI tools

Fosowl:I’ve spent the last two months building AgenticSeek, a privacy-focused alternative to cloud-based AI tools like ManusAI. It runs entirely on your machine—no API calls, no data leaks.<p>Why AgenticSeek?<p>Optimized for local LLMs (developed mostly on an RTX 3060 running deepseek r1 14b).<p>Truly private: All components (TTS, STT, planner) run locally.<p>More responsive than alternatives (we respond fast to issues + active Discord).<p>Designed to be fun—think JARVIS-like voice control, multi-agent workflows, and a slick web UI.<p>Current Features:<p>Web browsing (research + form filling), code write&#x2F;fix, file management&#x2F;search. Planning capabilites to use multiple agents for complex task.<p>Is it stable?
Prototype-stage—great for tinkerers.<p>Hoping to get feedback!

## 25. Show HN: An interactive demo of QR codes' error correction

Xiione:Hi HN!
This is a hobby project of mine that recently landed me my first interview and helped me get my first internship offers.<p>Draw on a QR code, and the health bars will accurately display how close the QR code is to being unscannable. How few errors does it take to break a QR code? How many errors can a QR code handle? Counters at the bottom track your record minimum and maximum damage. (Can you figure out how to break a QR code with 0.0% damage to the actual data region?)<p>Also, click on the magnifying glass button to toggle between &quot;draw mode&quot; and &quot;inspect mode&quot;.
I encourage you to use your phone&#x27;s camera to scan the code as you draw and undo&#x2F;redo to verify that the code really does break when the app says it does.<p>I wrote the underlying decoder in C++, and it&#x27;s compiled to WebAssembly for the website.<p>I hope you find it interesting.
