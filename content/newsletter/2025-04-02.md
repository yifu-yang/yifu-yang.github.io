## 9. Show HN: Offline SOS signaling+recovery app for disasters/wars

nizarmah:A couple of months ago, I built this app to help identify people stuck under rubble.<p>First responders have awesome tools. But in tough situations, even common folks need to help.<p>After what happened in Myanmar, we need something like this that works properly.<p>It has only been tested in controlled environments. It can also be improved; I know BLE is not _that_ effective under rubble.<p>If you have any feedback or can contribute, don&#x27;t hold back.

## 19. Show HN: I made Confetti: a configuration language file format

hgs3:Hello everyone, I created Confetti: a simple, typeless, and localization-friendly configuration language designed for human-editable configuration files.<p>In my opinion, JSON works well for data interchange, but it&#x27;s overused for configuration, it&#x27;s not localization-friendly, and it&#x27;s too syntactically noisy. INI is simple but lacks hierarchical structures and doesn&#x27;t have a formal specification. Confetti is intended to bridge the gap.<p>I aim to keep Confetti simple and minimalistic, while encouraging others to extend it. Think of it like Markdown for configuration files: there&#x27;s a core specification, but your welcome to create your own variations that suit your needs.

## 22. Show HN: I vibecoded a 35k LoC recipe app

tomblomfield:Over the last 2-3 weeks, I vibecoded the recipe app that I always wished existed - recipeninja.ai . It now includes a fully interactive voice assistant so you don&#x27;t need to get your dirty hands over your new iPad when you&#x27;re cooking.<p>Background: I’m a startup founder turned investor. I taught myself (bad) PHP in 2000, and picked up Ruby on Rails in 2011. I’d guess 2015 was the last time I wrote a line of Ruby professionally. Last month, I decided to use Windsurf to build a Rails 8 API backend and React front-end app, using OpenAI&#x27;s realtime API for voice-to-voice responses. Over the last few days, I also used Claude Code and Gemini 2.5 Pro for some of the trickier features. 35,000 LoC later, this is what I built!<p>The site uses function-calling to navigate the site in realtime as you chat with the voice assistant, which I think is pretty neat.<p>For the long version, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomblomfield.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;778601470234918912&#x2F;vibecoding-a-production-app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomblomfield.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;778601470234918912&#x2F;vibecoding-...</a><p>I&#x27;d love any feedback you have!<p>Demo video of the voice assistant: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kRhVc9D5kcg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kRhVc9D5kcg</a><p>Generate and edit new recipes: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VwwZF6dHcHg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VwwZF6dHcHg</a>

## 25. Show HN: Zig Topological Sort Library for Parallel Processing

ww520:I believe the best way to learn a language is by doing an in-depth project. This is my first Zig project intended for learning the ropes on publishing a Zig package. It turns out to be quite solid and performant. It might be a bit over-engineered.<p>This little library is packed with the following features:<p><pre><code>  - Building dependency graph from dependency data.
  - Performing topological sort on the dependency graph.
  - Generating dependence-free subsets for parallel processing.
  - Cycle detection and cycle reporting.</code></pre>

## 29. Launch HN: ASim (YC S21) – Mobile app that generates mobile apps

dli123:Hey HN, we’re Daniel and Daniel (the Daniels) from aSim (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;</a>). aSim is a mobile app that can generate immediately usable and shareable mobile apps from your phone.<p>Tools like bolt.new and v0 have made it easier to build websites by just chatting with an LLM, but things have been lagging on the mobile side. We’ve always been suckers for well-made mobile apps, but today, it is still extremely difficult to build mobile apps with LLMs on your computer, and nearly impossible to do it from your phone.<p>We built aSim to make it easy to build prototypes, “trinket” apps, or just random fun things all async from your phone. You can check our landing page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;</a>) for some ideas of different types of apps. Hopefully we can bring some life to your side project graveyard, or at least make the graveyard even more numerous.<p>Here’s a demo video of the generation process: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;_3VCl13oMGc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;_3VCl13oMGc</a><p>And here are the actual one-shotted apps I made in that video:<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@dli&#x2F;s&#x2F;157003&#x2F;make-an-app-where-i-can-upload-an-image-and-it">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@dli&#x2F;s&#x2F;157003&#x2F;make-an-app-where-i-can-upload...</a><p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@dli&#x2F;s&#x2F;157014&#x2F;make-me-an-app-that-is-a-clone-of-yikyak">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@dli&#x2F;s&#x2F;157014&#x2F;make-me-an-app-that-is-a-clone...</a><p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@dli&#x2F;s&#x2F;157006&#x2F;make-me-a-chess-timer-app-for-in-person-chess">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@dli&#x2F;s&#x2F;157006&#x2F;make-me-a-chess-timer-app-for-...</a><p>All of our app generations also get access to a set of APIs that help get the ball rolling on some basic functionality. These APIs range from LLM usage and image generation to having shared state with your friends, and globally among all users. We’re always on the lookout for new API integrations (i.e. Spotify and Maps) so please let us know if you need any!<p>We’ve had a small cohort of beta users that have been making what we think are some pretty cool apps. Here’s some of our favorites:<p>- Pokemon-style Gacha Game - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@evan&#x2F;s&#x2F;126948&#x2F;elves-vs-monsters">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@evan&#x2F;s&#x2F;126948&#x2F;elves-vs-monsters</a><p>- OpenStreetMap stats: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@lake&#x2F;s&#x2F;104102&#x2F;osm-stats">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@lake&#x2F;s&#x2F;104102&#x2F;osm-stats</a><p>- Star wars idle game: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@jojaspero&#x2F;s&#x2F;29102">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@jojaspero&#x2F;s&#x2F;29102</a><p>- Find your Meyers Briggs - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@typewhisperer&#x2F;s&#x2F;135964&#x2F;jung-mirror">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@typewhisperer&#x2F;s&#x2F;135964&#x2F;jung-mirror</a> (&lt;-- just for fun, you don’t have to believe in MB :))<p>- AI Tic Tac Toe - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@hashmelons&#x2F;s&#x2F;105561&#x2F;ai-tic-tac">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;@hashmelons&#x2F;s&#x2F;105561&#x2F;ai-tic-tac</a><p>Behind the scenes, we’re generating a modified version of Typescript React Native that can be parsed and compiled into simpler instructions that can be sent to mobile devices on the fly. We’ve ripped out some parts of the TSC library, as well as lean heavily on AcornJS to massage the (mostly usable) LLM code into something that can actually be run. We have a bunch of static analyzers, as well as leaning on web runtimes to catch runtime errors (as well as take screenshots), though at the very end of the day, we lean the most on our users to play around with their creations and remix them into something great.<p>It’s currently completely free to use, so we hope you check out aSim at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asim.sh&#x2F;</a> and enjoy it as much as we have while building it! Let us know what features you’d like to see and any problems you have with your generations.
