## 10. Show HN: Muscle-Mem, a behavior cache for AI agents

edunteman:Hi HN! Erik here from Pig.dev, and today I&#x27;d like to share a new project we&#x27;ve just open sourced:<p>Muscle Mem is an SDK that records your agent&#x27;s tool-calling patterns as it solves tasks, and will deterministically replay those learned trajectories whenever the task is encountered again, falling back to agent mode if edge cases are detected. Like a JIT compiler, for behaviors.<p>At Pig, we built computer-use agents for automating legacy Windows applications (healthcare, lending, manufacturing, etc).<p>A recurring theme we ran into was that businesses <i>already</i> had RPA (pure-software scripts), and it worked for them in most cases. The pull to agents as an RPA alternative was <i>not</i> to have an infinitely flexible &quot;AI Employees&quot; as tech Twitter&#x2F;X may want you to think, but simply because their RPA breaks under occasional edge-cases and agents can gracefully handle those cases.<p>Using a pure-agent approach proved to be highly wasteful. Window&#x27;s accessibility APIs are poor, so you&#x27;re generally stuck using pure-vision agents, which can run around $40&#x2F;hr in token costs and take 5x longer than a human to perform a workflow. At this point, you&#x27;re better off hiring a human.<p>The goal of Muscle-Mem is to get LLMs out of the hot path of repetitive automations, intelligently swapping between script-based execution for repeat cases, and agent-based automations for discovery and self-healing.<p>While inspired by computer-use environments, Muscle Mem is designed to generalize to any automation performing discrete tasks in dynamic environments. It took a great deal of thought to figure out an API that generalizes, which I cover more deeply in this blog:

## 11. Show HN: Semantic Calculator (king-man+woman=?)

nxa:I&#x27;ve been playing with embeddings and wanted to try out what results the embedding layer will produce based on just word-by-word input and addition &#x2F; subtraction, beyond what many videos &#x2F; papers mention (like the obvious king-man+woman=queen). So I built something that doesn&#x27;t just give the first answer, but ranks the matches based on distance &#x2F; cosine symmetry. I polished it a bit so that others can try it out, too.<p>For now, I only have nouns (and some proper nouns) in the dataset, and pick the most common interpretation among the homographs. Also, it&#x27;s case sensitive.
