## 15. Show HN: I wrote a modern Command Line Handbook

petr25102018:TLDR: I wrote a handbook for the Linux command line. 120 pages in PDF. Updated for 2025. Pay what you want.<p>A few years back I wrote an ebook about the Linux command line. Instead of focusing on a specific shell, paraphrasing manual pages, or providing long repetitive explanations, the idea was to create a modern guide that would help readers to understand the command line in the practical sense, cover the most common things people use the command line for, and do so without wasting the readers&#x27; time.<p>The book contains material on terminals, shells (compatible with both Bash and Zsh), configuration, command line programs for typical use cases, shell scripting, and many tips and tricks to make working on the command line more convenient. I still consider it &quot;an introduction&quot; and it is not necessarily a book for the HN crowd that lives in the terminal, but I believe that the book will easily cover 80 % of the things most people want or need to do in the terminal.<p>I made a couple of updates to the book over the years and just finished a significant one for 2025. The book is not perfect. I still see a lot of room for improvement, but I think it is good enough and I truly want to share it with everyone. Hence, pay what you want.<p>EXAMPLE PAGES: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1PkUcLv83Ib6nKYF88n3OBqeeVffAs3Sp&#x2F;view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1PkUcLv83Ib6nKYF88n3OBqeeVff...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commandline.stribny.name&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commandline.stribny.name&#x2F;</a>

## 18. I'm starting a social club to solve the male loneliness epidemic

nswizzle31:The other day I saw a post here on HN that featured a NYT article called &quot;Where Have All My Deep Male Friendships Gone?&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44098369">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44098369</a>) and it definitely hit home. As a guy in my early 30s, it made me realize how I&#x27;ve let many of my most meaningful friendships fade. I have a good group of friends - and my wife - but it doesn&#x27;t feel like when I was in college and hung out with a crew of 10+ people on a weekly basis.
So, I decided to do something about it. I’ve launched wave3.social - a platform to help guys build in-person social circles with actual depth. Think parlor.social or timeleft for guys: curated events and meaningful connections for men who don’t want their friendships to atrophy post-college.<p>It started as a Boston-based idea (where I live), but I built it with flexibility in mind so it could scale to other cities if there’s interest. It’s intentionally not on Meetup or Facebook - I wanted something that feels more intentional, with a better UX and less noise.<p>Right now, I&#x27;m in the “see if this resonates with anyone” stage. If this sounds interesting to you and you&#x27;re in Boston or another city where this type of thing might be needed, drop a comment or shot me an email. I&#x27;d love to hear any feedback on the site and ideas on how we can fix the male loneliness epidemic in the work-from-home era.

## 21. Show HN: Donut Browser, a Browser Orchestrator

andrewzeno:Hi HN,<p>I&#x27;m excited to share my open source project, a browser orchestrator. It&#x27;s purpose is to make it easy to manage many browser profiles on one system. Currently it only works on MacOS, but since I&#x27;ve built it using Tauri (which is a Rust backend and TypeScript frontend), I expect to add Linux and Windows support in the future.<p>I&#x27;ve built it primarily for myself as I use a lot of browsers and having an easy way to manage all of my profiles would make (have made, actually) my dock less cluttered haha. Also, part of why I built it is because as someone who doesn&#x27;t really care about anti-detect features (which I might support in the future), I don&#x27;t understand how they cost so much for a very limited number of profiles in pretty much all anti-detect browsers. I feel like a lot of people feel the same and will cover their use cases with my free tool.<p>If you try it, please share your feedback! I haven&#x27;t seen any open source projects like this and want to learn more about how people might use it.
