## 24. Show HN: Tattoy – a text-based terminal compositor

tombh:Whereas this is mostly a terminal eye-candy project to get you street cred, it does have some serious aspects.<p>Firstly it solves the age-old problem of low-contrast text, like when you `ls` a broken symlink and the red background colour is too near your current theme&#x27;s foreground colour. Tattoy solves this by using none other than the web&#x27;s WCAG 2.1 contrast algorithm for accessible text.<p>Secondly, an explicit design goal is that Tattoy should be able to polyfill new terminal protocols, the `xwayland` of the TTY if you will. Say if we want to experiment with completely deprecating ANSI codes, then any application that uses a new protocol can be run in Tattoy which itself runs in any ANSI-standard terminal emulator as normal. You can read more about this idea here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tattoy.sh&#x2F;news&#x2F;an-end-to-terminal-ansi-codes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tattoy.sh&#x2F;news&#x2F;an-end-to-terminal-ansi-codes&#x2F;</a><p>But ultimately this has been something more akin to an art project, something to enjoy for the sheer aesthetic pleasure.
