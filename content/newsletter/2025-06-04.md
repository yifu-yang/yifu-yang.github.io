## 9. Show HN: Hacker News historic upvote and score data

clacker-o-matic:Hi yall!<p>I&#x27;ve been using hacker news for a while but one of the things I started wanting recently was the ability to have alerts for any stories I post.<p>The thing that pushed me over the edge was Hackclub&#x27;s shipwrecked <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shipwrecked.hackclub.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shipwrecked.hackclub.com&#x2F;</a> (hackathon in the boston bay for anyone that can make 4 projects over the summer and get at least one of them to go viral). One of the options for &quot;going viral&quot; was to get to the front page of hacker news but I was constantly scared that I would miss it getting on there lol so I whipped up a quick slackbot to send alerts to a channel. It was dead simple but it did work.<p>Once I had the bot I realized I could do wayyyy more with the data I was collecting so I decided to add some historical data initially thinking I would generate graphs and then embed them in the message but decided to quickly try using Bun.serve to host a quick dashboard mainly since I wanted to see how the developer experience was.
Spoiler it is amazing. I&#x27;ve gotten really inspired by web components and the idea of only using universally supported `html`, `css`, and `js`. Bun results in an amazingly nice developer experience where you can just import the `index.html` and assign it to your root route and be done. Sorry for shilling about bun but it truly was one of my favorite parts of building this besides drizzle.<p>The dashboard has a graph of the points earned and position on the leaderboard over time (updated every 5 minutes) and then the expected stats like peak points, peak position, author, and comment count.<p>Also btw all the code is open source ofc on both my tangled repo (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tangled.sh&#x2F;@dunkirk.sh&#x2F;hn-alerts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tangled.sh&#x2F;@dunkirk.sh&#x2F;hn-alerts</a>) as well as a github repo (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;taciturnaxolotl&#x2F;hn-alerts">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;taciturnaxolotl&#x2F;hn-alerts</a>) and you can try the hosted version at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.dunkirk.sh" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.dunkirk.sh</a>
I&#x27;m planning to add the ability to just install the slackbot to any workspace and have workspace specific leaderboards but that will require a bit of refactoring and probably abandoning the slack-edge package.<p>Also you can view specific item&#x27;s data by simply replacing news.yc.com with hn.dunkirk.sh like: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.dunkirk.sh&#x2F;item?id=44115853" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.dunkirk.sh&#x2F;item?id=44115853</a>

## 12. Show HN: Ephe – A minimalist open-source Markdown paper for today

unvalley:Hi HN,<p>I built Ephe, open-source markdown paper for daily todos and thoughts.<p>No sign-up, no ads, no subscriptions, no AI.<p>## Why I made this<p>We have plenty of Markdown editors. And too many overwhelming to-do apps.
But few tools combine both in a way that’s lightweight and focused.
I thought that all I need is a single page to organize today. So I built Ephe.<p>It uses CodeMirror v6, React(v19, React Compiler) and Vite with rolldown.<p>## What makes it different<p>“Ephe” comes from ephemeral. 
The main goal is to organize what you need to do today.
It isn’t for teams. It’s a quiet space for your own priorities.<p>Give it a spin if that sounds useful to you.

## 26. Ask HN: Startup getting spammed with PayPal disputes, what should we do?

june3739:Longtime user posting from a new account out of an abundance of caution.<p>I founded an e-commerce marketplace startup. We use PayPal&#x27;s Multiparty APIs (PayPal Commerce Platform) for checkout. For the 10 days, someone has been bombarding us with purchases that they later dispute. There&#x27;s consistent pattern to it:<p>* They use an email address that has no footprint online, always from the same two domains
* They use an unverified PayPal account to pay
* They pay a low amount, not always the same, in a narrow range for a digital item
* All of the charges were disputed within a few hours<p>They&#x27;re not doing this through our API. The purchase process requires a browser because of the way our payment form is configured. There&#x27;s an amount of variation to each purchase that tells us they&#x27;re automating a browser. Logs indicate that they&#x27;re changing IP each time. The events come in bursts and seem to be spaced to avoid automated detection.<p>We added the typical mitigations to our network stack and code. A few are still slipping through. Logs indicate a high amount of bot traffic.<p>PayPal does not seem equipped to deal with this. Their support is always extremely slow, relies on canned responses, and to date has a very limited understanding of how their own Multiparty APIs work. Their phone support people will not talk with me, they see no indication that my PayPal account is affiliated with these purchases in any way. They want each of our sellers to contact them independently, which we know will result in disparate cases that don&#x27;t tell the complete story or offer any assistance.<p>Has anyone encountered anything like this before? We&#x27;re struggling to find the motive or intended outcome by the attacker(s). We&#x27;re a small company with a niche audience, we&#x27;ve never had a conflict with anyone that got serious enough that we&#x27;d expect them to come after us like this.<p>Any thoughts and recommendations would be greatly appreciated. We feel like we are on our own here and are unsure of how to handle it.
