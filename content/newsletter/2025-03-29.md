## 14. Show HN: An Almost Free, Open Source TURN Server

cookie_monsta:Hi HN,<p>I have been messing around with WebRTC for a few years now but when it comes to the TURN server I never quite got to my gold standard of free, self-hosted and open source. I decided to give it a go using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure&#x27;s free tier, meaning that my total spend got down to domain name hosting. I know plenty of people have been burnt by Oracle in the past, but I have had servers running on the free tier for 5 years now without so much as a hiccup. Regardless, the concepts will be the same using any cloud based server.<p>This is the first time I&#x27;ve written up an end-to-end technical how-to like this and the audience I am writing for is really myself - I know just enough about networks and web dev and Linux, etc to get all this running and there are plenty of snippets out there on the web that tell you how to do one thing or another, but nowhere that puts it all together in one place so if I&#x27;m explaining what is obvious to you, my apologies - like I say, I&#x27;m writing to myself here.<p>I don&#x27;t know that this even is a Show HN - @dang, if it isn&#x27;t, please feel free to recategorise&#x2F;edit the title.<p>@Everybody else, I am happy to answer questions if I can but please bear in mind that I am not claiming to be an expert on any of the tech gathered together to make this work.

## 17. Show HN Pianoboi – displays sheet music as you play your piano

bcowde:I made a software library for displaying piano music 7 years back, and recently ported it to the web (which is now easier than even ever).<p>It displays sheet music as you play, and let&#x27;s you take snapshots of specific chords, then keeps a running list of chords as keyboard visuals (instead of just displaying sheet music).<p>Just a simple tool for songwriting&#x2F; figuring out songs by ear, or just understanding music key theory (which I&#x27;m admittedly a still a beginner at).

## 23. Show HN: Hexi – Modern header-only network binary serialisation for C++

Chaosvex:Over the last few years, I&#x27;ve needed an easy way to quickly serialise and deserialise various network protocols safely and efficiently. Most of the libraries that existed at the time were either quite heavy, had less than stellar performance, or were an abstraction level above what I was looking for.<p>I decided to put together my own class to do the job, starting with an easy, low-overhead way to move bytes in and out of arbitrary buffers. Along the way, it picked up useful bits and pieces, such as buffer structures and allocators that made the byte shuffling faster, often being able to do it with zero allocations and zero copies. Safety features came along to make sure that malicious packet data or mistakes in the code wouldn&#x27;t result in segfaults or vulnerabilities.<p>It&#x27;s become useful enough to me that I&#x27;ve packaged it up in its own standalone library on the chance that it might be useful to others. It has zero dependencies other than the standard library and has been designed for quick integration into any project within minutes, or seconds with a copy paste of the amalgamated header. It can be used in production code but it&#x27;s also ideal for for those that want to quickly hack away at binary data with minimal fuss.
