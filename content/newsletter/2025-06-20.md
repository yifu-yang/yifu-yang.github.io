## 2. Show HN: I wrote a new BitTorrent tracker in Elixir

dahrkael:Hello everyone!<p>I&#x27;m currently in a journey to learn and improve my Elixir and Go skills (my daily job uses C++) and looking through my backlog for projects to take on I decided Elixir is the perfect language to write a highly-parallel BitTorrent tracker.
So I have spent my free time these last 3 months writing one! Now I think it has enough features to present it to the world (and a docker image to give it a quick try).<p>I know some people see trackers as relics of the past now that DHT and PEX are common but I think they still serve a purpose in today&#x27;s Internet (purely talking about public trackers). That said there is not a lot going on in terms of new developments since everyone just throws opentracker in a vps a calls it a day (honorable exceptions: aquatic and torrust).<p>I plan to continue development for the foreseeable future and add some (optional) esoteric features along the way so if anyone currently operates a tracker please give a try and enjoy the lack of crashes.<p>note: only swarm_printout.ex has been vibe coded, the rest has all been written by hand.

## 10. Show HN: Tool to Automatically Create Organized Commits for PRs

edverma2:I&#x27;ve found it helps PR reviewers when they can look through a set of commits with clear messages and logically organized changes. Typically reviewers prefer a larger quantity of smaller changes versus a smaller quantity of larger changes. Sometimes it gets really messy to break up a change into sufficiently small PRs, so thoughtful commits are a great way of further subdividing changes in PRs. It can be pretty time consuming to do this though, so this tool automates the process with the help of AI.<p>The tool sends the diff of your git branch against a base branch to an LLM provider. The LLM provider responds with a set of suggested commits with sensible commit messages, change groupings, and descriptions. When you explicitly accept the proposed changes, the tool re-writes the commit history on your branch to match the LLM&#x27;s suggestion. Then you can force push your branch to your remote to make it match.<p>The default AI provider is your locally running Ollama server. Cloud providers can be explicitly configured via CLI argument or in a config file, but keeping local models as the default helps to protect against unintentional data sharing. The tool always creates a backup branch in case you need to easily revert in case of changing your mind or an error in commit re-writing. Note that re-writing commit history to a remote branch requires a force push, which is something your team&#x2F;org will need to be ok with. As long as you are working on a feature branch this is usually fine, but it&#x27;s always worth checking if you are not sure.

## 23. Show HN: EnrichMCP – A Python ORM for Agents

bloppe:I&#x27;ve been working with the Featureform team on their new open-source project, [EnrichMCP][1], a Python ORM framework that helps AI agents understand and interact with your data in a structured, semantic way.<p>EnrichMCP is built on top of [MCP][2] and acts like an ORM, but for agents instead of humans. You define your data model using SQLAlchemy, APIs, or custom logic, and EnrichMCP turns it into a type-safe, introspectable interface that agents can discover, traverse, and invoke.<p>It auto-generates tools from your models, validates all I&#x2F;O with Pydantic, handles relationships, and supports schema discovery. Agents can go from user → orders → product naturally, just like a developer navigating an ORM.<p>We use this internally to let agents query production systems, call APIs, apply business logic, and even integrate ML models. It works out of the box with SQLAlchemy and is easy to extend to any data source.<p>If you&#x27;re building agentic systems or anything AI-native, I&#x27;d love your feedback. Code and docs are here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;featureform&#x2F;enrichmcp">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;featureform&#x2F;enrichmcp</a>.
