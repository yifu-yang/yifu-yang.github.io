## 21. Show HN: Create your own finetuned AI model using Google Sheets

QueensGambit:Hello HN,<p>We built Promptrepo to make finetuning accessible to product teams — not just ML engineers. Last week, OpenAI’s CPO shared how they use fine-tuning for everything from customer support to deep research, and called it the future for serious AI teams. Yet most teams I know still rely on prompting, because fine-tuning is too technical, while the people who have the training data (product managers and domain experts) are often non-technical. With Promptrepo, they can now:<p>- Add training examples in Google Sheets<p>- Click a button to train<p>- Deploy and test instantly<p>- Use OpenAI, Claude, Gemini or Llama models<p>We’ve used this internally for years to power AI workflows in our products (Formfacade, Formesign, Neartail), and we&#x27;re now opening it up to others. Would love your feedback and happy to answer any questions!<p>---<p>Try it free - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promptrepo.com&#x2F;finetune" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;promptrepo.com&#x2F;finetune</a><p>Demo video - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=e1CTin1bD0w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=e1CTin1bD0w</a><p>Why we built it - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guesswork.co&#x2F;support&#x2F;post&#x2F;fine-tuning-is-the-future-and-now-its-within-every.anc-ddfd2598-5798-423d-b6ec-e7d84e98847a.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guesswork.co&#x2F;support&#x2F;post&#x2F;fine-tuning-is-the-future-...</a>

## 27. Show HN: Convert Large CSV/XLSX to JSON or XML in Browser

Botlabs:Hello HN,
I&#x27;m excited to share a project I&#x27;ve been working on: A simple, fast way to process huge CSV and XLSX files directly in your browser and export them as clean JSON or XML<p>Here&#x27;s a few things that makes this converter different: - runs in the browser - all parsing and conversion is client side can handle data any size data - automatically detects delimiters, encodings, and data types as it parses - Live preview with column renaming, search&#x2F;replace, and data cleanup - Export to JSON or XML — clean, structured output that can be used for API or Databases<p>backstory: I built this tool for myself. I work with massive CSV and TXT files, some over 10GB, and opening them in Excel would freeze my laptop, some of the online converters only limits to a certain size, so I started learning Python and pandas but ended up wasting so much time trying different delimiters or fixing badly structured data just to make it usable, and I thought this would be a really fun project to build<p>I&#x27;d love some feedback. Thank you<p>URL: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;csvforge.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;csvforge.com</a>

## 28. Show HN: ART – a new open-source RL framework for training agents

kcorbitt:Hey HN, I wanted to share a new project we&#x27;ve been working on for the last couple of months called ART (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenPipe&#x2F;ART">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OpenPipe&#x2F;ART</a>).<p>ART is a new open-source framework for training agents using reinforcement learning (RL). RL allows you to train an agent to perform better at any task whose outcome can be measured and quantified.<p>There are many excellent projects focused on training LLMs with RL, such as GRPOTrainer (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;docs&#x2F;trl&#x2F;main&#x2F;en&#x2F;grpo_trainer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;docs&#x2F;trl&#x2F;main&#x2F;en&#x2F;grpo_trainer</a>) and verl (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;volcengine&#x2F;verl">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;volcengine&#x2F;verl</a>). We&#x27;ve used these frameworks extensively for customer-facing projects at OpenPipe, but grew frustrated with some key limitations:<p>- Multi-turn workflows, where the agent calls a tool, gets a response, and calls another, are not well supported. This makes them a non-starter for any task that requires an agent to perform a sequence of actions.<p>- Other frameworks typically have low GPU efficiency. They may require multiple H100 GPUs just to train a small 7B parameter model, and aren&#x27;t able to keep the GPUs busy consistently during both the &quot;rollout&quot; and &quot;training&quot; phases of the training loop.<p>- Existing frameworks are typically not a convenient shape for integrating with existing agentic codebases. Existing trainers expect you to call raw text completion endpoints, and don&#x27;t automatically provide industry-standard chat completion APIs.<p>ART is designed to address these limitations and make it easy to train high-quality agents. We&#x27;ve also shared many details and practical lessons learned is in this post, which walks through a demo of training an email research agent that outperforms o3 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openpipe.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;art-e-mail-agent">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openpipe.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;art-e-mail-agent</a>). You can also find out more about ART&#x27;s architecture in our announcement post (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openpipe.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;art-trainer-a-new-rl-trainer-for-agents">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openpipe.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;art-trainer-a-new-rl-trainer-for-ag...</a>).<p>Happy to answer any questions you have!
