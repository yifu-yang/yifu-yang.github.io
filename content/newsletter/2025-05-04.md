## 4. I built a pixel art editor after playing Octopath Traveler II

Kobayashiii:After playing <i>Octopath Traveler II</i>, I was really inspired by its art style and decided to create my own pixel drawing app from scratch. It&#x27;s still in the early stages, but it already supports basic drawing, undo&#x2F;redo, and a clean UI focused on pixel-perfect design.<p>I plan to add frame-by-frame animation support in the next version.<p>You&#x27;re welcome to try it out and share your thoughts!  
If you like the project, a  on GitHub would mean a lot to me.<p>Live demo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ayanamiii.netlify.app&#x2F;<p>GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;KamiC6238&#x2F;ayanami

## 15. Show HN: Open-source sound effects and react library to spice up your website

lschneider:Hi all, I&#x27;ve been using sound effects in a few web-projects lately (mostly for notifications) and it&#x27;s always a pain to find good sound effects and then handle them in the browser. So, I compiled my learnings into an easy-to-use React library. It currently has ~70 sound effects (MIT licensed) and I&#x27;m happy to add more if you have any requests.<p>PS. the sound effects can of course be used without the React library!
