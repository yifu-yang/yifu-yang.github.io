## 2. Show HN: Duolingo-style exercises but with real-world content like the news

ph4evers:I&#x27;ve been working on a little side project that combines Duolingo-like listening comprehension exercises with real content .<p>Every video is transcribed to get much better transcripts than the closed captions. I filter on high quality transcripts, and afterwards a LLM selects only plausible segments for the exercises. This seems to work well for quality control and seems to be reliable enough for these short exercises.<p>Would love your thoughts!

## 16. Launch HN: Augento (YC W25) – Fine-tune your agents with reinforcement learning

lmeierhoefer:Hi HN, we’re the cofounders of Augento (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;augento.ai&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;augento.ai&#x2F;</a>). We’re building Deepseek R1-like fine-tuning as a service. You connect your agent, tell us when it’s right or wrong, and we deliver an LLM optimized for that agent. There’s a demo video <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=j5RQaTdRrKE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=j5RQaTdRrKE</a>, and our docs are at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.augento.ai&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.augento.ai&#x2F;</a>. It’s open for anyone to use at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;augento.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;augento.ai</a>.<p>Agents fail all the time, especially when you try to use them for something actually useful. Current solution approaches suck: prompting has intrinsic limits and supervised fine-tuning requires big explicit datasets that are hard to collect.<p>Two months ago, the DeepSeek R1 paper outlined a way to post-train LLMs with (almost) pure reinforcement learning. We took up their research and built a fine-tuning platform around that.<p>You let us intercept your agent&#x27;s data flow, and we deliver you a fine-tuned open-source model, that is trained on the agent&#x27;s specific task. Instead of providing big datasets of explicit fine-tuning samples, you provide a reward function, judging the model&#x27;s outputs.<p>Here are examples of what this can be used for:<p>Coding Agent: We fine-tuned a coding agent that was constantly making syntax errors and failed to handle semantic edge cases properly. By providing a reward function that evaluated code against the compiler, the agent learned not to produce these errors. The fine-tuned model reduced critical bugs by 40% with just 20 training samples.<p>MCP Tool Specialization: Imagine you have a custom set of internal tools using the MCP protocol, but your agent keeps selecting the wrong tool or passing incompatible parameters. You could fine-tune with a reward function that scores tool selection and parameter matching.<p>Browser Agent Navigation: If you&#x27;re building a browser agent that struggles with complex web UIs or specific sites, you could fine-tune it to better understand UI elements and navigation patterns. With a reward function that scores successful task completion (like &quot;find the best price for this product&quot; or &quot;complete this multi-step form&quot;), you could train an agent that better identifies clickable elements, understands form validation errors, and navigates through complex SPAs without getting stuck.<p>VLA Robot Control: If you&#x27;re using vision-language models to control robotic arms or other hardware, you could fine-tune for your specific actuator setup. With a reward function based on high-level task completion, you could train a Vision-Langauge-Action (VLA) model that translates natural language commands like &quot;move the red block behind the blue cylinder&quot; into actuator controls for your specific hardware.<p>As you see from these examples, the current paradigm is best suited for &quot;verifiable domains”, where it is possible to give an explicit function judging the model’s outputs. However, up next, we will also support an &quot;alignment mode&quot;, where you don&#x27;t have to provide a reward function but provide high-level feedback on past failure runs of your agent. Just tag where things went wrong, and we&#x27;ll handle the rest. This makes it even easier to improve your agents without needing to write formal reward functions.<p>Our platform is not itself open source, but it fine-tunes open-source language models. I.e. it is an alternative to the reinforcement fine-tuning API from OpenAI, but with Qwen, LLama, Deepseek, etc., and more customizability on the reward model. We charge users for the training and for their inference&#x2F;interaction with the model later on ($0 monthly flat fee + training cost + inference cost).<p>The platform is self-serving and open to use at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;augento.ai&#x2F;dashboard">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;augento.ai&#x2F;dashboard</a>. We’ll give you $20 in training credits, which should be enough for connecting your agent and delivering some observable improvement on your use case.<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback!
