## 23. Show HN: Aqua Voice 2 – Fast Voice Input for Mac and Windows

the_king:Hey HN - It’s Finn and Jack from Aqua Voice (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withaqua.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withaqua.com</a>). Aqua is fast AI dictation for your desktop and our attempt to make voice a first-class input method.<p>Video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withaqua.com&#x2F;watch">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withaqua.com&#x2F;watch</a><p>Try it here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withaqua.com&#x2F;sandbox">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;withaqua.com&#x2F;sandbox</a><p>Finn is uber dyslexic and has been using dictation software since sixth grade. For over a decade, he’s been chasing a dream that never quite worked — using your voice instead of a keyboard.<p>Our last post (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39828686">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=39828686</a>) about this seemed to resonate with the community - though it turned out that version of Aqua was a better demo than product. But it gave us (and others) a lot of good ideas about what should come next.<p>Since then, we’ve remade Aqua from scratch for speed and usability. It now lives on your desktop, and it lets you talk into any text field -- Cursor, Gmail, Slack, even your terminal.<p>It starts up in under 50ms, inserts text in about a second (sometimes as fast as 450ms), and has state-of-the-art accuracy. It does a lot more, but that’s the core. We’d love your feedback — and if you’ve got ideas for what voice should do next, let’s hear them!

## 28. Show HN: Comparing product rankings by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity

the1024:Hi HN! AI Product Rank lets you to search for topics and products, and see how OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity rank them. You can also see the citations for each ranking.<p>We’re interested in seeing how AI decides to recommend products, especially now that they are actively searching the web. Now that we can retrieve citations by API, we can learn a bit more about what sources the various models use.<p>This is increasingly becoming important - Guillermo Rauch said that ChatGPT now refers ~5% of Vercel signups, which is up 5x over the last six months. [1]<p>It’s been fascinating to see the somewhat strange sources that the models pull from; one hypothesis is that most of the high quality sources have opted out of training data, leaving a pretty exotic long tail of citations. For example, a search for car brands yielded citations including Lux Mag and a class action filing against Chevy for batteries. [2]<p>We&#x27;d love for you to give it a try and let me know what you think! What other data would you want to see?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;rauchg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1898122330653835656" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;rauchg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1898122330653835656</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;productrank.ai&#x2F;topic&#x2F;car-brands" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;productrank.ai&#x2F;topic&#x2F;car-brands</a>
