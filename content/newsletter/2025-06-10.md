## 1. Tell HN: Help restore the tax deduction for software dev in the US (Section 174)

dang:Companies building software in the US were hit hard a few years ago when the tax code stopped allowing deduction of software dev expenses. Now they have to be amortized over several years.<p>HN has had many discussions about this, including <i>The time bomb in the tax code that&#x27;s fueling mass tech layoffs</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44180533">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44180533</a> - (927 comments) a few days ago. Other threads are listed at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44203869">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=44203869</a>.<p>There&#x27;s currently a major effort to get this change reversed. One of the people working on it is YC&#x27;s Luther Lowe (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=itsluther">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=itsluther</a>). Luther has been organizing YC alumni to urge lawmakers to support this reversal. I asked him if we could do that on Hacker News too. He said yes—hence this thread :)<p>If you&#x27;re a US taxpayer and if you agree that software dev expenses should be deductible like they used to be, please sign this letter to the relevant committee members: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;d&#x2F;1DkRGeef2e_tU2xf3TyEyd2JLlmZH8sGs6hhuVkokgpw&#x2F;viewform?edit_requested=true" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;forms&#x2F;d&#x2F;1DkRGeef2e_tU2xf3TyEyd2JLlmZ...</a>.<p>(If you&#x27;re not a US person, please don&#x27;t sign the letter, since lawmakers will only listen to feedback from taxpayers and we don&#x27;t want to dilute the signal.)<p>I&#x27;m sure not everyone here agrees with us—HN is a big community, there&#x27;s no total agreement on anything—but this issue has as close to a community consensus as HN gets, so I think it makes sense to add our voices too.<p>Luther will be around to answer questions and hopefully HN can contribute to getting this done!

Instead, applications are compiled to WASM and run inside of an embedded WASM engine.<p>Other features:<p>* Fully graphical interface in HD resolution with mouse and keyboard support<p>* Desktop shell with window manager and contextual radial menus<p>* PCI and VirtIO drivers<p>* Ethernet and TCP stack<p>* Customizable UI toolkit providing various widgets, responsive layouts and flexible text rendering<p>* Embedded selection of applications including:<p><pre><code>  * A web browser supporting DNS, HTTPS and very basic HTML

  * A text editor

  * A Python terminal

## 19. Launch HN: Chonkie (YC X25) – Open-Source Library for Advanced Chunking

snyy:Hey HN! We&#x27;re Shreyash and Bhavnick. We&#x27;re building Chonkie (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chonkie.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chonkie.ai</a>), an open-source library for chunking and embedding data.<p>Python: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chonkie-inc&#x2F;chonkie">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chonkie-inc&#x2F;chonkie</a><p>TypeScript: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chonkie-inc&#x2F;chonkie-ts">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chonkie-inc&#x2F;chonkie-ts</a><p>Here&#x27;s a video showing our code chunker: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Xclkh6bU1P0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Xclkh6bU1P0</a>.<p>Bhavnick and I have been building personal projects with LLMs for a few years. For much of this time, we found ourselves writing our own chunking logic to support RAG applications. We often hesitated to use existing libraries because they either had only basic features or felt too bloated (some are 80MB+).<p>We built Chonkie to be lightweight, fast, extensible, and easy. The space is evolving rapidly, and we wanted Chonkie to be able to quickly support the newest strategies. We currently support: Token Chunking, Sentence Chunking, Recursive Chunking, Semantic Chunking, plus:<p>-  Semantic Double Pass Chunking: Chunks text semantically first, then merges closely related chunks.<p>-  Code Chunking: Chunks code files by creating an AST and finding ideal split points.<p>-  Late Chunking: Based on the paper (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2409.04701" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2409.04701</a>), where chunk embeddings are derived from embedding a longer document.<p>-  Slumber Chunking: Based on the &quot;Lumber Chunking&quot; paper (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2406.17526" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2406.17526</a>). It uses recursive chunking, then an LLM verifies split points, aiming for high-quality chunks with reduced token usage and LLM costs.<p>You can see how Chonkie compares to LangChain and LlamaIndex in our benchmarks: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chonkie-inc&#x2F;chonkie&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;BENCHMARKS.md">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chonkie-inc&#x2F;chonkie&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;BENCHMARKS....</a><p>Some technical details about the Chonkie package:  - ~15MB default install vs. ~80-170MB for some alternatives. - Up to 33x faster token chunking compared to LangChain and LlamaIndex in our tests. - Works with major tokenizers (transformers, tokenizers, tiktoken). - Zero external dependencies for basic functionality. - Implements aggressive caching and precomputation. - Uses running mean pooling for efficient semantic chunking. - Modular dependency system (install only what you need).<p>In addition to chunking, Chonkie also provides an easy way to create embeddings. For supported providers (SentenceTransformer, Model2Vec, OpenAI), you just specify the model name as a string. You can also create custom embedding handlers for other providers.<p>RAG is still the most common use case currently. However, Chonkie makes chunks that are optimized for creating high quality embeddings and vector retrieval, so it is not really tied to the &quot;generation&quot; part of RAG. In fact, We&#x27;re seeing more and more people use Chonkie for implementing semantic search and&#x2F;or setting context for agents.<p>We are currently focused on building integrations to simplify the retrieval process. We&#x27;ve created &quot;handshakes&quot; – thin functions that interact with vector DBs like pgVector, Chroma, TurboPuffer, and Qdrant, allowing you to interact with storage easily. If there&#x27;s an integration you&#x27;d like to see (vector DB or otherwise), please let us know.<p>We also offer hosted and on-premise versions with OCR, extra metadata, all embedding providers, and managed vector databases for teams that want a fully managed pipeline. If you&#x27;re interested, reach out at shreyash@chonkie.ai or book a demo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cal.com&#x2F;shreyashn&#x2F;chonkie-demo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cal.com&#x2F;shreyashn&#x2F;chonkie-demo</a>.<p>We&#x27;re eager to hear your feedback and comments! Thanks!

jgalecki:I just released my latest Godot project, a rhythm-based dungeon crawler a la Crypt of the Necrodancer. The entire game plays out in 16 x 9 pixels because of a dare from my game dev group. I&#x27;ve open-sourced (MIT) the code and project files. Of course, the music files I don&#x27;t own aren&#x27;t included in the Github project, but I&#x27;m releasing the game&#x27;s hand-crafted pixel sprites under CC0. The Github page also talks about some of the tricks you need to make the rhythm part of the game play nice with the dungeon crawling part.
