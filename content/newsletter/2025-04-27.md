## 2. Show HN: Remote-Controlled IKEA Deathstar Lamp

sephalon:Repainting the iconic IKEA PS 2014 lamp into the Deathstar from Star Wars has been a popular IKEA hack for quite some time.<p>This variant additionally replaces the manual, rope-operated mechanism to open and close the lamp with a remote-controlled motor.<p>The firmware is based on ESPHome, and its excellent Home Assistant integration enables one to implement higher-level features, like a &quot;sundial&quot; where the aperture of the Deathstar follows the sun elevation throughout the day (see  the timelapse video).<p>That said, I will not consider this project as complete until the Imperial March can be played over the stepper motor (just like the legendary Floppotron) ;-)

## 26. Path is a utility for working with paths

spyrja:A recent post here got me thinking about my own personal gripes with OS path handling offerings. So I&#x27;ve basically spent the passed couple of days working on a little project in an attempt to rectify the situation somewhat (in the spirit of cross-platform development). It should also work pretty well with existing tools. Let me know what you think, and feel free to open an issue or a pull-request if you have any problems getting it running it on your system.
