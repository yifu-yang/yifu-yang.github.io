## 8. Show HN: MCP server for searching and downloading documents from Anna's Archive

iosifache:I was looking around for an MCP server that could connect Anna&#x27;s Archive to Claude Desktop, as I wanted to be able to search and download books directly through the interface.<p>I couldn&#x27;t find any public implementations, so ended up building one myself.<p>What it does?<p>- It searches Anna&#x27;s Archive by keywords.
- It downloads books from search results.
- It works directly in Claude Desktop through MCP.<p>Check out the repository&#x27;s README for detailed installation and configuration instructions.<p>The code is fully open source and builds run on GitHub Actions for transparency.<p>I figured I&#x27;d share, since I couldn&#x27;t be the only one wanting this functionality!

## 17. Show HN: Petrichor – a free, open-source, offline music player for macOS

kushalpandya:I have a large collection of music files gathered over the years, so I was sorely missing a decent offline music player that can serve as a frontend for the collection. I tried several Mac apps over the years, but since streaming music is mainstream now, there aren&#x27;t good offline music players that meet my needs. So I spent the last 3 months building Petrichor! The idea is to solve my problem and learn Swift UI development along the way, while giving back to the community with this open-source project! Here&#x27;s a list of features it has, with more getting added in future;<p>- Everything you&#x27;d expect from an offline music player!<p>- Map your music folders and browse your library in an organised view.<p>- Create playlists and manage the play queue interactively.<p>- Browse music using folder view when needed.<p>- Pin anything (almost!) to the sidebar for quick access to your favourite music.<p>- Navigate easily: right-click a track to go to its album, artist, year, etc.<p>- Native macOS integration with menubar and dock playback controls, plus dark mode support.<p>- Search quickly through large libraries containing thousands of songs.<p>The app is still in alpha, so things may look unpolished, but I&#x27;ve been testing the alpha builds for the past few weeks and fixing issues as I find them for v1 release. I welcome any feedback (and contributions!) on GitHub repo. Please give it a try and let me know what you think!

## 27. Show HN: I built a playground to showcase what Flux Kontext is good at

Zephyrion:Hi HN,<p>After spending some time with the new `flux kontext dev` model, I realized its most powerful capabilities aren&#x27;t immediately obvious. Many people might miss its true potential by just scratching the surface.<p>I went deep and curated a collection of what I think are its most interesting use cases – things like targeted text removal, subtle photo restoration, and creative style transfers.<p>I felt that simply writing about them wasn&#x27;t enough. The best way to understand the value is to see it and try it for yourself.<p>That&#x27;s why I built FluxKontextLab (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluxkontextlab.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fluxkontextlab.com</a>).<p>On the site, I&#x27;ve presented these curated examples with before-and-after comparisons. More importantly, there&#x27;s an interactive playground right there, so you can immediately test these ideas or your own prompts on your own images.<p>My goal is to share what this model is capable of beyond the basics.<p>It&#x27;s still an early project. I&#x27;d love for you to take a look and share your thoughts or any cool results you generate.
