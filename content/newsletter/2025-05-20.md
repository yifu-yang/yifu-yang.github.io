## 13. Ask HN: Do people actually pay for small web tools?

scratchyone:Hey all, there&#x27;s a lot of web stuff and tools I&#x27;d love to make that I think would honestly be worth a small subscription ($5&#x2F;mo maybe). I&#x27;m always a bit wary of approaching these ideas though because I feel like nobody would ever pay for small web stuff?<p>I see a lot of success stories but I don&#x27;t know how much they can be trusted. Those of you who have built small single-use indie tools, do you find that anybody at all actually subscribes? A lot of the stuff I wanna try involves AI so I&#x27;d have to make sure subscription profits offset the cost of providing free demos.

## 18. Launch HN: Better Auth (YC X25) – Authentication Framework for TypeScript

bekacru:Hi HN! We’re Bereket and KinfeMichael of Better Auth (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.better-auth.com&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.better-auth.com&#x2F;</a>), a comprehensive authentication framework for TypeScript that lets you implement
everything from simple auth flows to enterprise-grade systems directly on your own database, embedded in your backend.<p>To be clear—we’re not building a 3rd party auth service. Our goal is to make rolling your own auth so ridiculously easy that you’ll never need one.<p>Here are some YouTube videos explaining how it works (we did make our own video but weren’t happy with it and these videos do a great job):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hFtufpaMcLM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hFtufpaMcLM</a> - a really good overview<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QurjwJHCoHQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QurjwJHCoHQ</a> - also a good overview and dives a little deeper into the code<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RKqHrE0KyeE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RKqHrE0KyeE</a> - short and clear<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Atev8Nxpw7c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Atev8Nxpw7c</a> - with TanStack framework<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=n6rP9d3RWo8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=n6rP9d3RWo8</a> - a full-on 2 hour tutorial<p>Auth has been a pain point for many developers in the TypeScript ecosystem for a while. Not because there aren’t options but because most fall into 2 buckets: (1) Third-party services like Auth0 which own your user data, lock you into a black-box solution and are often super expensive; or (2) open source libraries like NextAuth that cover the basics but leave you stitching your own solution together from there.<p>For Better Auth. the kick off moment was building a web analytics platform and wanting to add an organization feature - things like workspaces, teams, members, and granular permissions. I assumed there’d be something out there I could plug in to NextAuth (the popular and kind of the only library), but there wasn’t. The only options were to build everything from scratch or switch to a 3rd party auth provider. I even tried hacking together a wrapper around NextAuth to support those features, but it was hacky. That’s when we decided to take a step back and build a proper auth library from the ground up with a plugin ecosystem that lets you start simple and scale as needed. That frustration turned into Better Auth.<p>Better Auth lets you roll your own auth directly on your backend and database, with support for everything from simple auth flows to enterprise-grade systems without relying on 3rd party services.<p>It comes with built-in features for common auth flows, and you can extend it as needed through a plugin ecosystem whether that’s 2FA, passkeys, organizations, multi-session, SSO, or even billing integration with Stripe.<p>Unlike 3rd party auth providers, we’re just a library you install in your own project. It’s free forever, lives entirely in your codebase, and gives you full control. You get all the features you’d expect from something like Auth0 or Clerk plus even more through our plugin system, including things like billing integrations with Stripe or Polar. Most libraries stop at the basics but Better Auth is designed to scale with your needs while keeping things simple when you don’t need all the extras.<p>We’re currently building an infrastructure layer that works alongside the framework to offer features that are hard to deliver as just a library—e.g. an admin dashboard with user analytics, bot&#x2F;fraud&#x2F;abuse detection, secondary session storage, and more. This will be our commercial offering. For this, there’s a waitlist at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.better-auth.build" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.better-auth.build</a>. However, this is only optional infrastructure for teams that need these capabilities. The library is free and open source and will remain so.<p>We’d love your feedback!
