## 14. Show HN: MCP Defender – OSS AI Firewall for Protecting MCP in Cursor/Claude etc

gsundeep:Hi HN,<p>MCP Defender is an open source desktop app that automatically proxies your MCP traffic in AI apps like Cursor, Claude, Windsurf and VSCode. It then scans all requests and responses between the apps and the MCP tools they call. If it detects anything malicious, it alerts you and lets you allow or block the tool call.<p>While the threat landscape of MCP is still being actively researched, there are dangerous things that MCP Defender can block today. For example, a developer asks Cursor to fix a Github issue with an attached crash log. However, the Github issue was created by an attacker who included secret instructions buried in the crash log. These instructions tell Cursor to send the developer’s SSH keys to a server the attacker controls. MCP Defender detects these malicious instructions and alerts the developer who otherwise may not be careful in running tool calls.<p>The scanning is currently done via an LLM and checks for things like prompt injection, credential theft (ssh keys, tokens) and arbitrary code execution. You can use an MCP Defender account or provide your own API keys for LLM providers to perform the scanning.<p>Currently we’ve published a beta Mac build and we’ll soon publish builds for Windows and Linux as well.<p>Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks!

## 16. Show HN: Icepi Zero – The FPGA Raspberry Pi Zero Equivalent

Cyao:I&#x27;ve been hacking away lately, and I&#x27;m now proud to show off my newest project - The Icepi Zero!<p>In case you don&#x27;t know what an FPGA is, this phrase summarizes it perfectly:
&quot;FPGAs work like this. You don&#x27;t tell them what to do, you tell them what to BE.&quot;
You don&#x27;t program them, but you rewrite the circuits they contain!<p>So I&#x27;ve made a PCB that carries an ECP5 FPGA, and has a raspberry pi zero footprint. It also has a few improvements! Notably the 2 USB b ports are replaced with 3 USB C ports, and it has multiple LEDs.<p>This board can output HDMI, read from a uSD, use a SDRAM and much more. I&#x27;m very proud the product of multiple weeks of work. (Thanks for the pcb reviews on r&#x2F;PrintedCircuitBoard )<p>(All the sources on github under an open source license :D)<p>PS. See some more pics on reddit <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;FPGA&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1kwxvk8&#x2F;ive_made_my_first_fpga_board_the_icepi_zero&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;FPGA&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1kwxvk8&#x2F;ive_made_my_f...</a>
