## 21. Show HN: MCPGod: Fine-grained control over MCP clients, servers, and tools

gavinuhma:Hey everyone,
I&#x27;ve wanted an easy way to control which mcp server tools are available to clients. So for example, I might want a gmail server to only expose the read tool (but not send, delete etc).<p>I figured if I create a cli for spawning mcp servers, I could intercept the stdin, stdout, stderr etc and modify what the clients see when they are making calls to list tools, resources, and prompts.<p>Well it worked!<p>In the initial version you can easily add a server to claude with a safe list of tools:<p>npx -y mcpgod add @modelcontextprotocol&#x2F;server-everything --client claude --tools=echo,add<p>Now when you load Claude Desktop, it will only discover the echo and add tools from that server. It&#x27;s a nice way to keep the agents in line :)<p>You can check it out here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcpgod&#x2F;cli" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mcpgod&#x2F;cli</a><p>It will also log everything that a client is doing to ~&#x2F;mcpgod&#x2F;logs.<p>Currently it only has support for claude, but it will be easy to add cursor, cline, windsurf, etc.<p>With the `tools` command you can list all of a servers tools, and even call a tool directly from the command line, which is pretty fun.<p>I was thinking it would be nice to create a UI for it to easily enable&#x2F;disable servers and tools for each client, inspect logs, view analytics, etc.<p>Thanks for reading!

ehmorris:Hey everybody, you might remember my older game, Lander! It made a big splash on Hacker News about 2 years ago. I&#x27;m still enjoying writing games with no dependencies. I&#x27;ve been working on Bubbles for about 6 months and would love to see your scores.<p>If you like it, you can build your own levels with my builder tool: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ehmorris.com&#x2F;bubbles&#x2F;builder&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ehmorris.com&#x2F;bubbles&#x2F;builder&#x2F;</a> and share the levels here or via Github.
