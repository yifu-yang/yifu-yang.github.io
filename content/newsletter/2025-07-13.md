## 20. Show HN: I made a JSFiddle-style playground to test and share prompts fast

eugenegusarov:I built this out of frustration as I lead the development of AI features at Yola.com.<p>Prompt testing should be simple and straightforward. All I wanted was a simple way to test prompts with variables and jinja2 templates across different models, ideally somthing I could open during a call, run few tests, and share results with my team. But every tool I tried hit me with a clunky UI, required login and API keys, or forced a lengthy setup process.<p>And that&#x27;s not all.<p>Then came the pricing. The last quote I got for one of the tools on the market was $6,000&#x2F;year for a team of 16 people in a use-it-or-loose-it way. For a tool we use maybe 2–3 times per sprint. That’s just ridiculous!<p>IMO, it should be something more like JSFiddle. A simple prompt playground that does not require you to signup, does not require API keys, and let&#x27;s experiment instantly, i.e. you just enter a browser URL and start working. Like JSFiddle has. And mainly, something that costs me nothing if I&#x27;m or my team is not using it.<p>Eventually I gave up looking for solution and decided to build it by myself.<p>Here it is: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;langfa.st" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;langfa.st</a><p>Help me find what&#x27;s wrong or missing or does not work from you perspctive.<p>P.S. I did not put any limits or restrictions yet, so test it wisely. Don&#x27;t make me broke, please.
