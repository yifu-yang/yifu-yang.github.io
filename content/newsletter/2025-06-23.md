## 3. Show HN: Ariadne – A Rust implementation of aperiodic cryptography

ciphernomad-org:Hello HN, we&#x27;re CipherNomad, the research initiative behind this project.<p>The Ariadne Protocol is our exploration of a different cryptographic model. The work began with an observation of primitives like the Lion transform, which use a static, hardcoded sequence of operations. This led us to ask: What if the cryptographic &quot;program&quot; wasn&#x27;t a constant, but a dynamic, history-dependent variable?<p>Our first step was a &quot;Cryptographic Virtual Machine&quot; that took an explicit list of operations (a &quot;Path&quot;). This worked, but required sharing the Path object—an explicit dependency that needed to be managed.<p>The Ariadne Protocol is the maturation of that idea. It eliminates the explicit Path by making it implicit and emergent.<p>The core design is:<p>The Labyrinth: A large, deterministically-generated binary tree of cryptographic rounds.<p>The Thread: The secret path taken through the Labyrinth. This path is not stored or transmitted. It&#x27;s rediscovered for each block of data by computing a keyed hash of the CVM&#x27;s secret state and the public ciphertext chunk: hash(key, state, chunk).<p>This makes the cipher aperiodic: because the state ratchets forward after every block, the sequence of operations is guaranteed to never repeat. It also creates inherent tamper evidence—any modification to the ciphertext &quot;snaps the thread&quot; and turns subsequent output into noise.<p>This is experimental, unaudited alpha software. We are publishing it under CC0 because we believe foundational work like this should be an unrestricted public good.
