## 11. Show HN: I rewrote an outdated React Native map clustering library

hadat:Hey Hacker News,<p>I&#x27;m a long-time lurker and wanted to share a project I just finished building.<p>Like many React Native developers, I needed to add marker clustering to a map in my app. The most popular library for this, react-native-maps-clustering, was fantastic in its day but has become outdated and no longer works with modern versions of Expo, React Native, and their dependencies.<p>After hitting a wall of compatibility issues, I decided to take on the challenge of rewriting it from the ground up, focusing on a modern toolchain and a better developer experience.<p>The journey was a lot more challenging than I anticipated. It turned into a deep dive into solving dependency hell with different versions of @types&#x2F;react, wrestling with build tool configurations for pnpm, bob, and ESLint, and ensuring everything was strictly typed with TypeScript. It felt like a classic case of yak shaving, but I was determined to create a solution that &quot;just works&quot; for developers today.<p>The result is RN Super Cluster, a performant, fully-typed, and easy-to-use clustering library for react-native-maps.<p>What it does:
It provides a &lt;ClusteredMapView &#x2F;&gt; component that you can use as a drop-in replacement for the standard &lt;MapView &#x2F;&gt;. Any &lt;Marker &#x2F;&gt; components you place inside will be automatically clustered.<p>Key Features:<p><pre><code>    Modern &amp; Maintained: Built with a modern toolchain and designed to be actively maintained.

    Fully-Typed: Written entirely in TypeScript to prevent common errors and improve autocompletion.

    High-Performance: Uses supercluster under the hood for extremely fast geospatial clustering.

    Spiderfier: At the maximum zoom level, overlapping markers automatically &quot;spiderfy&quot; (spread out on a spiral) so they can be individually tapped.

    Customizable: You can provide your own custom components for rendering clusters, and callbacks for handling press events.
</code></pre>
This was a passion project born out of necessity, and I hope it can save other React Native developers the headaches I went through.<p>I would love to get your feedback, and contributions are more than welcome!<p>GitHub: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;suwi-lanji&#x2F;rn-maps-clustering">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;suwi-lanji&#x2F;rn-maps-clustering</a>

## 29. Show HN: OffChess – Offline chess puzzles app

avadhesh18:Hi HN!<p>I&#x27;m the developer of rdx, a mildly popular ad-free, privacy and user friendly Reddit client. This time, I made something for a very specific use case: solving chess puzzles with no internet.<p>Why? Well, my Wi-Fi is terrible in the bathroom—and that&#x27;s where I do some of my best thinking. I tried printing out “mate in X” puzzles to solve offline, but they weren’t fun without interaction. So I built OffChess.<p>OffChess is an iPhone&#x2F;Android app that contains over 100,000 chess puzzles, fully offline and completely ad-free. You can solve puzzles by category (Mate in 1&#x2F;2&#x2F;3&#x2F;4&#x2F;5, tactics like pins&#x2F;forks&#x2F;skewers, or openings like Sicilian&#x2F;French, etc). You gain or lose points based on how you perform, so there&#x27;s a light rating system to keep things engaging.<p>No accounts, no tracking, no monthly subscriptions, no internet required. Just pure, old-school tactical chess training, wherever you are.<p>You can check out the iPhone&#x2F;iPad app at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chess-puzzles-offchess&#x2F;id6744736661?platform=iphone">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;chess-puzzles-offchess&#x2F;id67447...</a> or the Android app at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.offchess">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.offchess</a><p>Would love feedback, bug reports, or suggestions.<p>Thanks!
