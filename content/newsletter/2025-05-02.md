## 10. Show HN: OSle – A 510 bytes OS in x86 assembly

shikaan:(sorry about double posting, I forgot to put Show HN in front in the original <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=43863689">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=43863689</a> thread)<p>Hey all,
As a follow up to my relatively successful series in x86 Assembly of last year[1], I started making an OS that fits in a boot sector. I am purposefully not doing chain loading or multi-stage to see how much I can squeeze out of 510bytes.<p>It comes with a file system, a shell, and a simple process management. Enough to write non-trivial guest applications, like a text editor and even some games. It&#x27;s a lot of fun!<p>It comes with an SDK and you can play around with it in the browser to see what it looks like.<p>The aim is, as always, to make Assembly less scary and this time around also OS development.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41571971">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41571971</a>

## 20. Show HN: Kubetail – Real-time log search for Kubernetes

andres:Hi Everyone!<p>Kubetail is a general-purpose logging dashboard for Kubernetes, optimized for tailing logs across multi-container workloads in real-time. With Kubetail, you can view logs from all the containers in a workload (e.g. Deployment or DaemonSet) merged into a single chronological timeline, delivered to your browser or terminal.<p>I launched Kubetail on HN last year and at that time the top request was to add search. Now I&#x27;m happy to say we finally have search available in our latest official release (cli&#x2F;v0.4.3, helm&#x2F;v0.10.1). You can check it out in action here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kubetail.com&#x2F;demo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kubetail.com&#x2F;demo</a><p>Kubetail normally fetches logs using the Kubernetes API, which does not have search built-in. To enable search, click the “Install” button in the GUI or run `kubetail cluster install` in the CLI to deploy a DaemonSet that places a Kubetail agent on every node. Each agent runs a custom Rust binary powered by ripgrep; it scans the node’s log files and streams only matching lines to your browser or terminal. You can think of a Kubetail search as &quot;remote grep&quot; for your Kubernetes logs. Now you don’t need to download an entire log file just to grep it locally.<p>Since last year we&#x27;ve also added some other neat features that users find helpful. In particular, we built a simple CLI tool that starts the web dashboard on your desktop:<p><pre><code>    # Install
    brew install kubetail

    # Run
    kubetail serve
</code></pre>
We also added a powerful logs sub-command to the CLI that you can use to follow container logs or even fetch all the records in a given time window to analyze them in more detail locally (quick-start):<p><pre><code>    # Follow example
    $ kubetail logs deployments&#x2F;web \
        --with-ts \
        --with-pod \
        --follow

    # Fetch example
    $ kubetail logs deployments&#x2F;web \
        --since 2025-04-20T00:00:00Z \
        --until 2025-04-21T00:00:00Z \
        --all &gt; logs.txt
</code></pre>
We’ve added a lot more features since last year but these are the ones I wanted to highlight.<p>I hope you like what we&#x27;re doing with Kubetail! Your feedback is very valuable so please let us know what you think in the comments here or in our Discord chat.<p>Andres
