## 8. I'm Peter Roberts, immigration attorney who does work for YC and startups. AMA

proberts:I&#x27;ll be here for the next 6 hours. As usual, there are countless possible topics and I&#x27;ll be guided by whatever you&#x27;re concerned with but as much as possible I&#x27;d like to focus on the recent changes and potential changes in U.S. immigration law, policy, and practice. Please remember that I am limited in providing legal advice on specific cases for obvious liability reasons because I won&#x27;t have access to all the facts. Please stick to a factual discussion in your questions and comments and I&#x27;ll try to do the same in my responses. Thank you!

## 14. Ask HN: Any insider takes on Yann LeCun's push against current architectures?

vessenes:So, Lecun has been quite public saying that he believes LLMs will never fix hallucinations because, essentially, the token choice method at each step leads to runaway errors -- these can&#x27;t be damped mathematically.<p>In exchange, he offers the idea that we should have something that is an &#x27;energy minimization&#x27; architecture; as I understand it, this would have a concept of the &#x27;energy&#x27; of an entire response, and training would try and minimize that.<p>Which is to say, I don&#x27;t fully understand this. That said, I&#x27;m curious to hear what ML researchers think about Lecun&#x27;s take, and if there&#x27;s any engineering done around it. I can&#x27;t find much after the release of ijepa from his group.

## 20. Show HN: Web Audio Spring-Mass Synthesis

cochlear:Hi, I&#x27;m the author of this little Web Audio toy which does physical modeling synthesis using a simple spring-mass system.<p>My current area of research is in sparse, event-based encodings of musical audio (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cochlea.xyz&#x2F;sparse-interpretable-audio-codec-paper.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cochlea.xyz&#x2F;sparse-interpretable-audio-codec-pa...</a>).  I&#x27;m very interested in decomposing audio signals into a description of the &quot;system&quot; (e.g., room, instrument, vocal tract, etc.) and a sparse &quot;control signal&quot; which describes how and when energy is injected into that system.  This toy was a great way to start learning about physical modeling synthesis, which seems to be the next stop in my research journey.  I was also pleasantly surprised at what&#x27;s possible these days writing custom Audio Worklets!
