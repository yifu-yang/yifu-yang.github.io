## 1. Show HN: Typed-FFmpeg 3.0–Typed Interface to FFmpeg and Visual Filter Editor

lucemia51:Hi HN,<p>I built typed-ffmpeg, a Python package that lets you build FFmpeg filter graphs with full type safety, autocomplete, and validation. It’s inspired by ffmpeg-python, but addresses some long-standing issues like lack of IDE support and fragile CLI strings.<p>What’s New in v3.0:
 •  Source filter support (e.g. color, testsrc, etc.)
 •  Input stream selection (e.g. [0:a], [1:v])
 •  A new interactive playground where you can:
 • Build filter graphs visually
 • Generate both FFmpeg CLI and typed Python code
 • Paste existing FFmpeg commands and reverse-parse them into graphs<p>Playground link: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingbio.github.io&#x2F;typed-ffmpeg-playground&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;livingbio.github.io&#x2F;typed-ffmpeg-playground&#x2F;</a>
(It’s open source and runs fully in-browser.)<p>The internal core also supports converting CLI → graph → typed Python code. This is useful for building educational tools, FFmpeg IDEs, or visual editors.<p>I’d love feedback, bug reports, or ideas for next steps. If you’ve ever struggled with FFmpeg’s CLI or tried to teach it, this might help.<p>Thanks!

## 6. A toy RTOS inside Super Mario Bros. using emulator save states

notorious_pgb:This started as a throwaway metaphor in a blog post, but is now fully runnable: a toy RTOS with preemptive multitasking inside of Super Mario Bros. on the NES.<p>Essentially, this is:<p>- A rudimentary preemptive RTOS<p>- Using an unmodified NES emulator (FCEUX) as the CPU<p><pre><code>    - &quot;Unmodified&quot; depending on how you define terms
</code></pre>
- With emulator save states as the thread contexts<p>- With support for (very basic) mutexes, interrupt masking, and condition variables<p>- Demonstrated using Super Mario Bros. 1-1 with sections of the map dedicated to various synchronization primitives<p>There are many simplifications and shortcuts taken (doesn&#x27;t even have task priorities), and it doesn&#x27;t map 1:1 to true multithreading (e.g., emulator save states represent the state of the entire machine including RAM, whereas thread contexts represent a much more minimal slice), but I think it&#x27;s A) pretty interesting and B) a unique visceral explanation of threads.

## 7. Show HN: I rewrote my Mac Electron app in Rust

katrinarodri:A year ago, my co-founder launched Desktop Docs here on HN. It&#x27;s a Mac app we built with Electron that uses CLIP embeddings to search photos and videos locally with natural language. We got positive feedback from HN and our first paying customers, but the app was almost 1GB and clunky to use.<p>TLDR; rebuilding in Rust was the right move.<p>So we rewrote the app with Rust and Tauri and here are the results:<p>- App size is 83% smaller: 1GB → 172MB
- DMG Installer is 70% smaller: 232MB → 69.5MB
- Indexing files is faster: A 38-minute video now indexes in ~3 minutes instead of 10-14 minutes
- Overall more stability (old app used to randomly crash)<p>The original version worked, but it didn&#x27;t perform well when you tried indexing thousands of images or large videos. We lost a lot of time struggling to optimize Electron’s main-renderer process communication and ended up with a complex worker system to process large batches of media files.<p>For months we wrestled with indecision about continuing to optimize the Electron app vs. starting a full rebuild in Swift or Rust. The main thing holding us back was that we hadn’t coded in Swift in almost 10 years and we didn’t know Rust very well.<p>What finally broke us was when users complained the app crashed their video calls just running in background. I guess that’s what happens when you ship an app with Chromium that takes up 200mb before any application code.<p>Today the app still uses CLIP for embeddings and Redis for vector storage and search, except Rust now handles the image and video processing pipeline and all the file I&#x2F;O to let users browse their entire machine, not just indexed files.<p>For the UI, we decided to rebuild it from scratch instead of porting over the old UI. This turned out well because it resulted in a cleaner, simpler UI after living with the complexity of the old version.<p>The trickiest part of the migration was learning Rust. LLMs definitely help, but the Rust&#x2F;Tauri community just isn’t as mature compared to Electron. Bundling Redis into the app was a permissioning nightmare, but I think our solution with Rust handles this better than what we had with Electron.<p>All in, the rebuild took about two months and still needs some more work to be at total parity with its Electron version, but the core functionality of indexing and searching files is way more performant than before and that made it worth the time. Sometimes you gotta throw away working code to build the right thing.<p>AMA about Rust&#x2F;Tauri migration, Redis bundling nightmares, how CLIP embeddings work for local semantic search, or why Electron isn&#x27;t always the answer.

## 17. Show HN: Tesseral – Open-Source Auth

ucarion:Hi folks! I&#x27;m Ulysse, and Tesseral (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tesseral-labs&#x2F;tesseral">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tesseral-labs&#x2F;tesseral</a>) is open-source auth for B2B SaaS.<p>Early in my career, I worked on enterprise auth and security features at Segment. I&#x27;ve been obsessed with the subtle details of enterprise software ever since. For example, I wrote an implementation of SAML in the early days of the COVID pandemic because I thought it was fun.<p>Over the years, I&#x27;ve felt frustrated that too few people have seemed interested in making auth obvious for developers of business software. Auth really doesn&#x27;t need to be so confusing.<p>We made Tesseral to help software engineers get B2B auth exactly right – and focus their energy on building the features that users want.<p>You can use Tesseral to stand up a login page, authenticate your users, and manage their access to resources. Think of it like Auth0 or Clerk, but open source and built specifically for B2B apps. Among other things, that means that it’s designed for B2B multi-tenancy and includes enterprise-ready features like single sign-on (SAML SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), SCIM provisioning, and role-based access control (RBAC).<p>For those who expose public APIs, you can use Tesseral to manage API keys for your customers. You can even limit the scope of API keys to specific actions by using our RBAC feature.<p>We&#x27;ve taken care to make Tesseral powerful and secure enough to power real enterprise software but still leave it simple enough for any software developer to use. You don&#x27;t have to be a security expert to implement Tesseral. (By default, therefore, Tesseral imposes a few opinions. Let us know if you have a good reason to do something unusual, and we&#x27;ll work something out.)<p>If you want to experiment with Tesseral, you can host it yourself or use our hosted service. The hosted service lives at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;console.tesseral.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;console.tesseral.com</a>. You can find documentation here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tesseral.com&#x2F;docs">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tesseral.com&#x2F;docs</a>.<p>Here are a few simple demos:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IhYPzz3vB54" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IhYPzz3vB54</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t-JJ8TNjqNU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t-JJ8TNjqNU</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mwthBIRZO8k" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=mwthBIRZO8k</a><p>We&#x27;re in the early stages of the project, so we still have some gaps. We have more features, bug fixes, SDKs, and documentation on the way.<p>What have we missed? What can we do better? We&#x27;re eager to hear from the community!

## 26. Launch HN: MindFort (YC X25) – AI agents for continuous pentesting

bveiseh:Hey HN! We&#x27;re Brandon, Sam, and Akul from MindFort (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mindfort.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mindfort.ai</a>). We&#x27;re building autonomous AI agents that continuously find, validate, and patch security vulnerabilities in web applications—essentially creating an AI red team that runs 24&#x2F;7.<p>Here&#x27;s a demo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;e56faa07d90b417db09bb4454dce8d5a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;e56faa07d90b417db09bb4454dce8d5a</a><p>Security testing today is increasingly challenging. Traditional scanners generate 30-50% false positives, drowning engineering teams in noise. Manual penetration testing happens quarterly at best, costs tens of thousands per assessment, and takes weeks to complete. Meanwhile, teams are shipping code faster than ever with AI assistance, but security reviews have become an even bigger bottleneck.<p>All three of us encountered this problem from different angles. Brandon worked at ProjectDiscovery building the Nuclei scanner, then at NetSPI (one of the largest pen testing firms) building AI tools for testers. Sam was a senior engineer at Salesforce leading security for Tableau. He dealt firsthand with juggling security findings and managing remediations. Akul did his master&#x27;s on AI and security, co-authored papers on using LLMs for ecurity attacks, and participated in red-teams at OpenAI and Anthropic.<p>We all realized that AI agents were going to fundamentally change security testing, and that the wave of AI-generated code would need an equally powerful solution to keep it secure.<p>We&#x27;ve built AI agents that perform reconnaissance, exploit vulnerabilities, and suggest patches—similar to how a human penetration tester works. The key difference from traditional scanners is that our agents validate exploits in runtime environments before reporting them, reducing false positives.<p>We use multiple foundational models orchestrated together. The agents perform recon to understand the attack surface, then use that context to inform testing strategies. When they find potential vulnerabilities, they spin up isolated environments to validate exploitation. If successful, they analyze the codebase to generate contextual patches.<p>What makes this different from existing tools? Validation through exploitation: We don&#x27;t just pattern-match—we exploit vulnerabilities to prove they&#x27;re real; - Codebase integration: The agents understand your code structure to find complex logic bugs and suggest appropriate fixes; - Continuous operation: Instead of point-in-time assessments, we&#x27;re constantly testing as your code evolves; - Attack chain discovery: The agents can find multi-step vulnerabilities that require chaining different issues together.<p>We&#x27;re currently in early access, working with initial partners to refine the platform. Our agents are already finding vulnerabilities that other tools miss and scoring well on penetration testing benchmarks.<p>Looking forward to your thoughts and comments!
