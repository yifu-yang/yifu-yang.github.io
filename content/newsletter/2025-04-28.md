## 14. Show HN: I486SX_soft_FPU – Software FPU Emulator for NetBSD 10 on 486SX

mezantrop:First Release is Here!<p>I&#x27;m excited to announce the first release of i486SX_soft_FPU — a software FPU emulator for the classic Intel 486SX CPU, running on NetBSD 10!<p>This project brings floating-point support back to life for 486SX machines, even though modern NetBSD versions no longer natively support processors without a hardware FPU.
If you&#x27;re into retrocomputing, operating system hacking, or just love old-school hardware, check it out!<p>Project page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mezantrop&#x2F;i486SX_soft_FPU">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mezantrop&#x2F;i486SX_soft_FPU</a>
Contributions, feedback, and testing are all very welcome!<p>Let&#x27;s keep these vintage machines alive!<p>#retrocomputing #NetBSD #486SX #opensource
