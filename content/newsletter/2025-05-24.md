## 2. Ask HN: Go deep into AI/LLMs or just use them as tools?

pella_may:I&#x27;m a software engineer with a solid full-stack background and web development. With all the noise around LLMs and AI, I’m undecided between two paths:<p>1. Invest time in learning the internals of AI&#x2F;LLMs, maybe even switching fields and working on them<p>2. Continue focusing on what I’m good at, like building polished web apps and treat AI as just another tool in my toolbox<p>I’m mostly trying to cut through the hype. Is this another bubble that might burst or consolidate into fewer jobs long-term? Or is it a shift that’s worth betting a pivot on?<p>Curious how others are approaching this—especially folks who’ve made a similar decision recently.

## 9. Show HN: HNRelevant – Add a "related" section to Hacker News

imadj:It&#x27;s been 2 years since the initial release [here](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36102610">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36102610</a>). The initial version was a very basic prototype which was not available anywhere beyond the GitHub repo. You had to install it as a userscript or load the extension manually.<p>Since then, it remained simple but better, new features include:<p>- Improved accuracy by also using comments to help gauge the topic of discussion and the right keywords.<p>- Published as plugin for more browsers: Chrome, Firefox (including android), and more recently Microsoft Edge.<p>- Support for narrow screens and mobile devices.<p>- Added preference controls.<p>You&#x27;re here because you love interesting HN discussions but they&#x27;re often buried away like hidden gems, so give it a try and let me know what you think.

## 15. Show HN: DoubleMemory – more efficient local-first read-it-later app

randomor:DoubleMemory started as an experiment to see if I can somehow automatically save all double cmd + c, as I often do instinctively, so I don&#x27;t need extensions to save links and text into an app, and avoiding flooding the capture history as regular clipboard managers does.<p>My motivation was not to create a read-it-later app, yet it evolved into this unique yet cohesive form of a read-it-later + bookmarking organizer + clipboard manager + card based note-taking app over the last 6 months. It also launches from the menu bar with a shortcut and navigates with keyboard shortcuts. My favorite part is instead of rendering a list of article titles, everything is rendered as pretty preview cards in a translucent Pinterest-like mood board. It also has a nifty iOS app, that will allow you to swipe with your thumbs between articles just like on iOS Safari...<p>Now that Pocket is closing, this is after Instapaper going back to indie and Omnivore and UpNext and numerous others closing over the years. All of these are cloud-hosted services, which got me reflecting: maybe this local-first architecture would be well positioned to build in this space.<p>Here is my not-so-scientific comparison:<p>## Domain<p>$10 vs $1M = 100,000x difference.<p>## Server running cost<p>No servers other than what&#x27;s running by iCloud vs $1M per year = 1mX difference<p>## Platforms<p>Apple only (mac + iphone + ipad) vs Multi platforms (windows, linux, android also supported) = 20X maintenance cost difference<p>## Capturing<p>No browser extensions required v.s. maintain all extensions for various browsers and extension stores = 5x difference<p>## Architecture<p>App receives the link, Apple generates the rich preview cards for thousands of different types of links, app caches these preview cards. 
vs.
Someone write some custom code for each link type or with Open Graph, one designer created one generic card that works for all links.
=
100x cost difference.<p>I know, Apple is coming for clipboards with more restrictions, which is basically a shared global state on Mac systems, DoubleMemory does also support other ways to capture: drag-n-drop to app&#x2F;menubar icon&#x2F;app icon, right click-&gt;Services menu, or Share sheet. We will add more auto-importers.<p>Also vibe coded some importers for Pocket, Omnivore and ReadWise here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doublememory.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;tools" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doublememory.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;tools</a><p>Everything in the app is free with no limits. Capturing is really step 0. You giving us a chance to save your content, doesn&#x27;t mean you are getting any values out of it (ain&#x27;t that the typical story of read-it-later apps? save-it and never-read-it). the eventual goal is to easily retrieve these content, and eventually consuming them. I hope to eventually launch paid features that aligns with these value generating workflows.<p>App Store link: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;doublememory&#x2F;id6737529034">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;doublememory&#x2F;id6737529034</a><p>Let me know what you think...

## 21. Show HN: Web Apps for Python Devs with Auto-Generated UI

ruben-davia:Hi HN,<p>We’re Afnan, Theo and Ruben. We’re all ML engineers or data scientists, and we kept running into the same thing: we’d write useful Python functions, either for ourselves or internal tools, and then hit a wall when we wanted to share them as actual apps.<p>We tried Streamlit and Gradio. They’re great to get something up quickly. But as soon as we needed more flexibility or something more polished, there wasn’t really a path forward. Rebuilding the frontend properly in React isn’t where we bring the most value.<p>So we started building Davia. You keep your code in Python, decorate the functions you want to expose, and Davia starts a FastAPI server on your localhost. It opens a window connected to your localhost where you describe the interface with a prompt. It then builds the interface, and you can deploy everything in one step. Think of it as Lovable, but for Python developers.<p>It works especially well for building AI tools. We built it to integrate tightly with LangGraph, so if you’re writing agents or workflows, you can turn them into real apps without leaving Python.<p>Docs and examples here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.davia.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.davia.ai</a>
GitHub: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;davia-ai&#x2F;davia">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;davia-ai&#x2F;davia</a><p>We’re still in early stages and would love feedback from others building internal tools or AI apps in Python.
