## 1. Launch HN: Vassar Robotics (YC X25) – $219 robot arm that learns new skills

charleszyong:Hi HN — I’m Charles from Vassar Robotics (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vassarrobotics.com&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vassarrobotics.com&#x2F;</a> - not much there but you can order the robot at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.vassarrobotics.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.vassarrobotics.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;navrim-robot-that-l...</a>)<p>Edit: the entire run sold out thanks to HN today—thank you all! And sorry to anyone who missed out. You can get in on the next batch here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vassarrobotics.com&#x2F;newsletter">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vassarrobotics.com&#x2F;newsletter</a>.<p>We are bringing an upgraded version of the long beloved SO-101 robot arms to a $219 price point with improved mechanical design and added intelligence. See what it can do here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;shorts&#x2F;xNyPKJZI400" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;shorts&#x2F;xNyPKJZI400</a> (demos are sped up as shown in the video)<p>I’ve spent a few years building RC planes (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cyo.ng&#x2F;hangar&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cyo.ng&#x2F;hangar&#x2F;</a>) and micro gas turbines (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;set.mit.edu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;set.mit.edu</a>), and I’ve always wished hardware were cheaper so more people could experiment.<p>I’m now launching a $219 desktop robot-arm kit that keeps LeRobot SO-101’s kinematics, swaps key parts for sturdier, more precise SLA prints, and adds two integrated 480 p cameras. After plenty of supplier haggling, the whole kit costs less than the twelve servos alone. I’ll release the updated mechanical design under an MIT license by June 30.<p>On the software side, I&#x27;ll also release an MIT-licensed MCP server by June 30 that exposes the local robot policy as tools for agentic LLMs (Opus 4, o3, etc.) to use in long-horizon tasks. Here&#x27;s how it works: You can teach the robot new skills through teleoperation. During inference, you simply talk to the agentic LLM using natural language instructions. The LLM then calls the local robot policy through MCP, automatically decomposing your high-level requests into executable robot commands.<p>Thanks to the LeRobot community for making such an amazing robot accessible. If you’ve contributed to the LeRobot GitHub repo, email hello@vassarrobotics.com for a 20% discount coupon as a small thank-you.<p>I’d love your feedback! Beyond manufacturing, cleaning up the codebase, and writing docs, I’m considering: a force-controlled gripper, a parallel-jaw gripper, an extra wrist DOF (matching the new Trossen and ARX arms), full force feedback on the leader arm (though that may triple the price), a more affordable version with lower resolution each joint, and a longer-reach variant. Which of these—or something else—would be most useful to you?<p>You can order it here if you want: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.vassarrobotics.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;navrim-robot-that-learns-skills-in-30-minutes">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.vassarrobotics.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;navrim-robot-that-l...</a>. (Edit: sold out! You can get in on the next batch here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vassarrobotics.com&#x2F;newsletter">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vassarrobotics.com&#x2F;newsletter</a>. I hope we can have your business in the future.)<p>Looking forward to any and all comments!<p>---<p>Edit: A quick explanation regarding shipping times (as stated on our shop page):<p>• The first batch of 20 units, which will be shipped by June 30, is sold out.<p>• The second batch of 100 units will be shipped by July 15 (unassembled kits) and July 21 (assembled units). The order limit is to ensure we can ship on time and maintain high quality.<p>For those who have already placed orders: I will reach out individually to ask if you would like to receive weekly progress updates from now until the shipping date.

## 4. Show HN: I made a 3D printed VTOL drone

tsungxu:I made this 130 mile capable VTOL drone in only 90 days. It can fly for 3 hours on a single charge. That would make it one of the longest range and endurance 3D printed VTOLs in the world.<p>This is the thing I&#x27;m most proud of building to date!<p>Before this project, I was a total CAD, 3D printing and aerodynamic modeling beginner. I had only built and flown one VTOL before.<p>SPECS<p>Wingspan: 3.9 ft (1200 mm)
Length: 2.5 ft (770 mm)
Weight: 5.6 lb (2.55kg)<p>Airframe: foaming PLA (Bambu PLA-Aero) and PETG structural parts printed on A1 printer, CFRP booms and spars<p>Battery: Li-ion silicon anode Amprius SA08 cells, 6s2p pack by Upgrade Energy
Motors: 2807 AOS for lift and cruise (unoptimized)
Lifting ESCs: 4 in 1 Holybro Tekko32 F4 45A 
Cruise ESC: Flycolor Raptor 5 45A
Lifting and cruise props: 7042 Gemfan (unoptimized)<p>Flight controller: Speedybee F405 Wing
GPS: M10<p>Firmware: Ardupilot 4.6.0<p>---<p>This video edit ended up shorter than I planned. Being my first Youtube video with significant post production effort, I underestimated the work required to make a longer in-depth video with voiceover, edited footage, etc.

## 15. Show HN: A “Course” as an MCP Server

codekarate:We wanted to build a course for new Mastra devs to get started quickly. However, we knew videos would go out of date and be more difficult to maintain.<p>We decided to launch our &quot;course&quot; as an MCP server. This way your coding agent actually teaches the course content to you and can help you write the code. We think this is a really interactive way to learn.<p>Using an editor with MCP support (such as Cursor, Windsurf, or VSCode), your code agent will call the appropriate MCP tools which will return context for the agent. This context tries to instruct the agent that it should be teaching you the content, not just doing the work for you.<p>The course is still pretty experimental and some models work better than others. Code is available in the Mastra Github repo in the mcp-docs-server package (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mastra-ai&#x2F;mastra&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;packages&#x2F;mcp-docs-server">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mastra-ai&#x2F;mastra&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;packages&#x2F;mcp-d...</a>)

## 21. Launch HN: BitBoard (YC X25) – AI agents for healthcare back-offices

arcb:Hi HN! We’re Connor and Ambar, and we’re working on BitBoard (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitboard.work">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitboard.work</a>). We build AI agents that handle repetitive administrative tasks in healthcare clinics like filling out intake forms, prepping charts, or managing referrals.<p>We were early employees at Forward, which provided primary care across the US. To scale this, we relied on thousands of remote contractors to do repetitive administrative work like reconciling patient records, and scheduling follow-ups based on care plans. It was a huge bottleneck—expensive, error-prone, and always pulling attention away from clinical care. Our software solutions were always too brittle, never managing to handle the variance of clinical data we oversaw.<p>AI, when applied well, is capable of performing a lot of the tasks we manually did. So we decided to take another crack at the problem by building today what we would have liked to have back then, and to help clinics use it.<p>Clinics send us their SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures—for example, “prep a patient chart from these records before a visit”), and we turn them into AI agents that do the work. These agents act like remote contractors: they log into EHRs, navigate internal tools, and do the work in the background. Unlike classical RPA, we build in verification and deterministic checks, so customers can confirm it was done right. 
Unlike low-code tools, there’s nothing new to learn. Customers don’t have to touch a UI or maintain logic. They just hand us the task, and we do it. Clinicians don’t want more screens! They erode attention and cause weird bottlenecks in operations because someone has to drive them. Our product is built to address this.<p>Here’s a demo video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t_tQ0fYo85g" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=t_tQ0fYo85g</a>. We’re not self-serve yet, but we deploy with customers in days after onboarding them. We’re working on speeding that up.<p>One of our early customers is a fast-growing obesity medicine group. Their MAs were spending 15 to 20 minutes per patient just entering intake form data into the EHR. That one task was taking up 30% of their MA time. We took it over in a week. It’s now fully automated, and they’ve cleared the backlog and sped up visits.<p>A few technical problems are specifically relevant to building healthcare agents:<p>- Unreliable interfaces: many EHRs and clinic tools don’t follow modern web standards, making automation brittle. We’ve forked browser-use to solve some of these challenges. We’re working on analogous infrastructure to let agents operate on desktops and across a wide range of APIs.<p>- Verification: in healthcare, tasks need to be provably correct. We embed deterministic checks into each workflow so agents can confirm the task was completed as expected and the output is accurate.<p>- Workflow generation: clinic SOPs are written in natural language and vary widely, yet still describe the actual process that works for clinics.<p>We charge per task, based on complexity. We’re HIPAA compliant, audit-logged, and operate in a zero-retention environment unless auditing requires otherwise.<p>A meaningful part is building trust in a high-stakes environment like healthcare. Part of that is making the product reliable. But another educational part is learning how to introduce a new concept like “agents” to clinics. We’re working on the right ways to describe them, to onboard them, to measure them. Endearingly, one of our customers’ agents is named “Robert Ott”, and they refer to him by name in their weekly updates like he’s a member of the team :) We’re learning a lot and have a long way to go.<p>We’d love to meet other folks who 1. work in medical groups or health systems and want to offload repetitive work, and 2. are building in this space and want to trade notes. We’re happy to share everything we’ve learned so far.<p>And this is a big space, with a lot of learnings from personal stories, from clinicians, technologists, administrators, and more. What do you make of it? We’d love to hear from you.

## 27. Show HN: High End Color Quantizer

big-nacho:This is a personal project I&#x27;ve been working on for a long time now.<p>I stumbled upon the color quantization problem while doing something related for work. I then found an interesting paper for which I could find no implementations online, and the thing went from &quot;let&#x27;s implement this paper&quot; to getting pretty obsessed with the whole thing.<p>It&#x27;s at an early, eaaaarly stage. There&#x27;s a lot of work to be done, and it&#x27;s a memory hog, but generally speaking works quite well, and the output is for the most part very high quality, so I&#x27;m happy to share it as beta.
