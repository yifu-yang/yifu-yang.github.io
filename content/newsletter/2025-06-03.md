## 13. Show HN: A toy version of Wireshark (student project)

lixiasky:Hi everyone,<p>I recently published a small open-source project. It’s a minimal network packet analyzer written in Go — designed more like a learning toy than a replacement for Wireshark.<p>It currently supports parsing basic protocols like TLS, DNS, and HTTP, and includes a tiny fuzzing engine to test payload responses. You can inspect raw packet content directly from the terminal. The output is colored for readability, and the code structure is kept simple and clear.<p>The entire program is very small — just about 400 lines of Go code. I know it’s not anywhere near Wireshark’s level, and I still use Wireshark myself for real-world analysis. But I built it as a personal experiment in network parsing and to understand protocol behavior more directly.<p>If you&#x27;re curious or would like to try it out, the project is here:
 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lixiasky&#x2F;vanta">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lixiasky&#x2F;vanta</a><p>I&#x27;m happy to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or critiques. It’s just a little network toy, but maybe someone out there finds it useful or fun.<p>Thanks for reading!

absurdwebsite:I’ve been building absurd, mostly useless web projects for fun — and I publish one every month at absurd.website.<p>These are deliberately non-functional, weird, sometimes funny, sometimes philosophical — and usually totally unnecessary.<p>Some examples:<p>Sexy Math — solve math problems to reveal erotic images.<p>Trip to Mars — a real-time simulation that takes 7 months to finish.<p>Add Luck to Your e-Store — add a waving cat widget to boost your conversion via superstition.<p>Microtasks for Meatbags — the future: AI gives prompts, humans execute.<p>Invisible Lingerie — it’s sexy. And invisible.<p>Artist Death Tracker — art prices spike when artists die. We track that.<p>Open Celebrity — one open-source face, shared by all. Together we make her famous.<p>I just enjoy exploring what the web can be when it doesn’t try to be “useful”.<p>Would love to hear what you think — and absurd ideas are always welcome.

## 20. Show HN: Onlook – Open-source, visual-first Cursor for designers

hoakiet98:Hey HN, I’m Kiet – one half of the two-person team building Onlook (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.onlook.com&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.onlook.com&#x2F;</a>), an open-source [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onlook-dev&#x2F;onlook&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;onlook-dev&#x2F;onlook&#x2F;</a>] visual editor that lets you edit and create React apps live on an infinite canvas.<p>We launched Onlook [1][2] as a local-first Electron app almost a year ago. Since then, “prompt-to-build” tools have blown up, but none let you design and iterate visually. We fixed that by taking a visual-first, AI-powered approach where you can prompt, style, and directly manipulate elements in your app like in a design tool.<p>Two months ago, we decided to move away from Electron and rewrite everything for the browser. We wanted to remove the friction of downloading hundreds of MBs and setting up a development environment just to use the app. I wrote more here [3] about how we did it, but here are some learnings from the whole migration:<p>1. While most of the React UI code can be reused, mapping from Electron’s SPA experience to a Next.js app with routes is non-trivial on the state management side.<p>2. We were storing most of the data locally as large JSON objects. Moving that to a remote database required major refactoring into tables and more loading states. We didn’t have to think as hard about querying and load time before.<p>3. Iframes in the browser enforce many more restrictions than Electron webview. Working around this required us to inject code directly into the user project in order to do cross-iframe communication.<p>4. Keeping API keys secure is much easier on a web application than an Electron app. In Electron, every key we leave on the client can be statically accessed. Hence, we had to proxy any SDK we used that required an API key into a server call. In the web app, we can just keep the keys on the server.<p>5. Pushing a release bundle in Electron can take 1+ hours. And some users may never update. If we had a bug in the autoupdater itself, certain users could be “stranded” in an old version forever, and we’d have to email them to update. Though this is still better than mobile apps that go through an app store, it’s still very poor DX.<p>How does Onlook for web work?<p>We start by connecting to a remote “sandbox” [4]. The visual editing component happens through an iframe. We map the HTML element in the iframe to the location in code. Then, when an edit is made, we simulate the change on the iframe and edit the code at the same time. This way, visual changes always feel instant.<p>While we’re still ironing out the experience, you can already:
- Select elements and prompt changes<p>- Update TailwindCSS classes via the styling UI<p>- Draw in new divs and elements<p>- Preview on multiple screen sizes<p>- Edit your code through an in-browser IDE<p>We want to make it trivial for anyone to create, style, and edit codebases. We’re still porting over functionalities from the desktop app — layers, fonts, hosting, git, etc. Once that is done, we plan on adding support for back-end functionalities such as auth, database, and API calls.<p>Special thank you to the 70+ contributors who have helped create the Onlook experience! I think there’s still a lot to be solved for in the design and dev workflow, and I think the tech is almost there.<p>You can clone the project and run it from our repo (linked to this post) or try it out at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.onlook.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.onlook.com</a> where we’re letting people try it out for free.<p>I’d love to hear what you think and where we should take it next :)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41390449">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=41390449</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40904862">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=40904862</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.onlook.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;developer&#x2F;electron-to-web-migration">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.onlook.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;developer&#x2F;electron-to-web-migra...</a><p>[4] Currently, the sandbox is through CodeSandbox, but we plan to add support for connecting to a locally running server as well

## 30. Show HN: Penny-1.7B Irish Penny Journal style transfer

deepsquirrelnet:Yesterday, in the bygone hour of the weekend, I undertook a most singular and fascinating endeavor, wherein I delved deep into the recesses of my mind, and, with a fervent zeal, breathed life into a most remarkable creation. I embarked upon the quest, with the singular object of fashioning an artificial construct, one imbued with the verdant essence of the Irish Penny Journal, an ancient and venerable tome that holds within its pages the whispered tales of a bygone era.<p>In my haste, I set forth to construct a dataset, a repository of those fleeting moments, these ephemeral sentences, which spoke of a bygone age. I procured a collection of these fleeting moments, these sentences, and with them, I synthetically conjured forth modern translations, an ingenious feat of substitution, which allowed my artificial construct to take on the guise of the language of the Irish Penny Journal.<p>Then, with great anticipation, I fashioned a small encoder, a humble instrument, with which to guide the artificial construct in its endeavors. I presented this encoder as a bribe, a reward, to a most ingenious system, one that trained a colossal language model, one of unbridled potential, one that was capable of weaving tales with the very essence of the Irish Penny Journal.<p>And lo! In the succeeding moments of time, I witnessed a most wondrous thing. My artificial construct, armed with this training, and guided by the whispers of the encoder, began to speak, to speak in the language of the Irish Penny Journal. The words it spoke were, indeed, the words of the past, imbued with the nostalgia of a forgotten era.<p>And thus, my friends, I have witnessed a most singular creation, one which embodies the language of the past, yet, in its most recent iteration, speaks to the present. A testament to the ingenuity of the human spirit, this artificial construct speaks of the bygone era, yet, with each word, it whispers to us, to us, of a future yet to come.<p>——<p>That’s Penny explaining itself to you. This was trained using GRPO only, in less than a day using a single A6000. I didn’t use any SFT, and only relied on a small encoder (MiniLM2) trained to classify texts from the Irish Penny Journal and their modern translations (synthetically produced).
