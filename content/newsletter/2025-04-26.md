## 10. Show HN: Empty Enter Expander – Type less in the terminal with this tool

waszabi:When you have a lot of aliases it can be difficult to remember how was the one you need named especially if you do not use it very often. You can also have files stored in a bin folder and look there to find the name. Another trick is to prepend your commands with a comma then type the comma and hit the Tab key to see only your own commands. There is an article about it somewhere on the Internet.<p>I needed something lightweight to always show me the available commands. Something to run with a few keystrokes. Something that stores commands in files and folder structures.<p>The idea was born at the time of using Linux Debian with the dwm (dynamic window manager). The first version was implemented in bash and it could do three things: start an application, expand text from a template and do a predefined automation on the selected application.<p>It was launched by a keyboard shortcut and opened the list of commands in a new terminal window. The commands were stored in nested folders and it was able to switch between the three modes (launcher, expander, automator). It also required only few keystrokes to do the desired action.<p>For instance, I was in the terminal and hit Ctrl+P. It opened a new terminal and listed applications to launch. I hit the Space to switch to the expander mode. Then I hit the g to enter the Git folder and s for the status. The result was that it put the git status to the terminal I was in before. This expander could be used in any application. It could insert the email template into the browser.<p>Then I migrated to macOS and really missed that tool. So I quickly wrote a zsh vesrion that consists only the expander mode and supports only the terminal. It is activated by hitting Enter on empty command and then it inserts the desired command right into the prompt. For example, when you hit Enter, g and s you will get the git status command to the prompt and you can then execute it with Enter. Of course, those commands and keys are defined by you. There are various and lenghty commands that I use on a daily basis like this and it saves a lot of typing.<p>The tool is called Empty Enter Expander. It is implemented for the zsh as of now. Please check it out at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;waszabi&#x2F;empty-enter-expander">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;waszabi&#x2F;empty-enter-expander</a> and let me know what you like or dislike about it.

## 13. Show HN: Formalizing Principia Mathematica using Lean

ndrwnaguib:This project aims to formalize the first volume of Prof. Bertrand Russell’s Principia Mathematica using the Lean theorem prover. Throughout the formalization, I tried to rigorously follow Prof. Russell’s proof, with no or little added statements from my side, which were only necessary for the formalization but not the logical argument. Should you notice any inaccuracy (even if it does not necessarily falsify the proof), please let me know as I would like to proceed with the same spirit of rigour. Before starting this project, I had already found Prof. Elkind’s formalization of the Principia using Rocq (formerly Coq), which is much mature work than this one. However, I still thought it would be fun to do it using Lean4.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ndrwnaguib.com&#x2F;principia&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ndrwnaguib.com&#x2F;principia&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ndrwnaguib&#x2F;principia">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ndrwnaguib&#x2F;principia</a>

## 14. Show HN: I used OpenAI's new image API for a personalized coloring book service

darajava:I&#x27;ve had an idea for a long time to generate a cute coloring book based on family photos, send it to a printing service, and then deliver it to people.<p>Last month, when OpenAI&#x27;s Sora was released for public use I (foolishly) thought I&#x27;d manually drag-and-drop each order’s photos into Sora&#x27;s UI and copy the resulting images back into my system. This took way too much time (about an hour for each of the few books I made and tested with family and friends). It clearly wasn&#x27;t possible to release this version because I’d be losing a huge amount of time on every order. So instead, I decided I&#x27;d finish off the project as best I could, put it &quot;on ice,&quot; and wait for the API release.<p>The API is now released (quicker than I thought it&#x27;d be, too!) and I integrated it last night. I&#x27;d love your feedback on any and all aspects.<p>The market is mostly family-based, but from my testing of the physical book I&#x27;ve found that both adults and kids enjoy coloring them in (it&#x27;s surprisingly cathartic and creative). If you would like to order one you can get 10% off by tapping the total price line item five times.

## 24. Show HN: Magnitude – open-source, AI-native test framework for web apps

anerli:Hey HN, Anders and Tom here - we’ve been building an end-to-end testing framework powered by visual LLM agents to replace traditional web testing.<p>We know there&#x27;s a lot of noise about different browser agents. If you&#x27;ve tried any of them, you know they&#x27;re slow, expensive, and inconsistent. That&#x27;s why we built an agent specifically for running test cases and optimized it just for that:<p>- Pure vision instead of error prone &quot;set-of-marks&quot; system (the colorful boxes you see in browser-use for example)<p>- Use tiny VLM (Moondream) instead of OpenAI&#x2F;Anthropic computer use for dramatically faster and cheaper execution<p>- Use two agents: one for planning and adapting test cases and one for executing them quickly and consistently.<p>The idea is the planner builds up a general plan which the executor runs. We can save this plan and re-run it with only the executor for quick, cheap, and consistent runs. When something goes wrong, it can kick back out to the planner agent and re-adjust the test.<p>It’s completely open source. Would love to have more people try it out and tell us how we can make it great.<p>Repo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;magnitudedev&#x2F;magnitude">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;magnitudedev&#x2F;magnitude</a>
