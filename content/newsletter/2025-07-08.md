## 10. Launch HN: Morph (YC S23) – Apply AI code edits at 4,500 tokens/sec

bhaktatejas922:Hey HN, I’m Tejas at Morph. We’ve built a blazing-fast model for applying AI-generated code edits directly into your files at 4,500+ tokens&#x2F;sec. No more slow full-file rewrites or brittle search-and-replace hacks.<p>Here&#x27;s a demo video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LdT8epGHJPk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=LdT8epGHJPk</a>.<p>Why? AI spits out code that can’t reliably be inserted into existing code. Full file rewrites, brittle search-and-replace hacks are too slow, expensive, or error-prone.<p>Morph&#x27;s approach:<p>- Your agent outputs edits “lazily”, referencing unmodified lines in the existing file (ex: &#x2F;&#x2F; ...existing code...)<p>- Morph instantly applies these edits to a file using our Fast Apply model + speculative decoding against the original file, making AI patches fast, reliable, and production-ready.<p>This approach was pioneered by Cursor last year, but their models aren’t available as APIs—so we built Morph for developers everywhere (with a large free tier!)<p>Live demo (no signup): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;morphllm.com&#x2F;dashboard">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;morphllm.com&#x2F;dashboard</a> and docs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.morphllm.com&#x2F;quickstart">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.morphllm.com&#x2F;quickstart</a><p>We have 2 Fast Apply models: morph-v3-fast - 4500+ tok&#x2F;sec, and morph-v3-large - 2500+ tok&#x2F;sec. These models power Fast Apply at create.xyz, databutton, continue.dev, and more!<p>We also provide retrieval models for embedding + reranking.
Next Up: Inline Edit Model (Cmd-K): Extremely fast inline edits - keep dev flow state; and Morph Tab API: Our Next Edit Prediction model guesses your next code edit + action with sub-500ms latency. It&#x27;s currently in private beta, but you can request early access here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;morphllm.com&#x2F;tab">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;morphllm.com&#x2F;tab</a><p>Hot takes:<p>1) Raw inference speed matters more than incremental accuracy gains for dev UX—agree or disagree?<p>2) Full-file rewrites by frontier models are legacy—Fast Apply edits win on speed, cost, reliability.<p>3) As benchmarks on narrow tasks saturate to 99%+, complexity is shifting from single frontier models to specialized inference-optimized models. As frontier models move upmarket, they&#x27;ll leave simple tasks behind, and they&#x27;ll be used to do tasks only frontier models can do<p>We’d love to hear your ideas and experiences with coding agents!

## 21. Show HN: NYC Subway Simulator and Route Designer

HeavenFox:Hello HN!<p>As a long term NYC resident, I have read countless articles on ideas tweaking subway services, but always found them hard to follow without visual aid. So over the long weekend I decided to build one. It has all the basic features: trains would spawn at their origin, stop at stations, and slow down if it gets too close to another. You can also design custom routes by piecing tracks together.<p>Have fun, and let me know what you think!
