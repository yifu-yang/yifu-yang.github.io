## 2. Show HN: AutoThink – Boosts local LLM performance with adaptive reasoning

codelion:I built AutoThink, a technique that makes local LLMs reason more efficiently by adaptively allocating computational resources based on query complexity.<p>The core idea: instead of giving every query the same &quot;thinking time,&quot; classify queries as HIGH or LOW complexity and allocate thinking tokens accordingly. Complex reasoning gets 70-90% of tokens, simple queries get 20-40%.<p>I also implemented steering vectors derived from Pivotal Token Search (originally from Microsoft&#x27;s Phi-4 paper) that guide the model&#x27;s reasoning patterns during generation. These vectors encourage behaviors like numerical accuracy, self-correction, and thorough exploration.<p>Results on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B:<p>- GPQA-Diamond: 31.06% vs 21.72% baseline (+43% relative improvement)<p>- MMLU-Pro: 26.38% vs 25.58% baseline<p>- Uses fewer tokens than baseline approaches<p>Works with any local reasoning model - DeepSeek, Qwen, custom fine-tuned models. No API dependencies.<p>The technique builds on two things I developed: an adaptive classification framework that can learn new complexity categories without retraining, and an open source implementation of Pivotal Token Search.<p>Technical paper: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=5253327" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=5253327</a><p>Code and examples: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codelion&#x2F;optillm&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;optillm&#x2F;autothink">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codelion&#x2F;optillm&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;optillm&#x2F;autoth...</a><p>PTS implementation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codelion&#x2F;pts">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codelion&#x2F;pts</a><p>I&#x27;m curious about your thoughts on adaptive resource allocation for AI reasoning. Have you tried similar approaches with your local models?

## 25. Launch HN: Relace (YC W23) – Models for fast and reliable codegen

eborgnia:Hey HN community! We&#x27;re Preston and Eitan, and we&#x27;re building Relace (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;relace.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;relace.ai</a>). We&#x27;re trying to make building code agents easy and cheap.<p>Here’s an example of our apply model vs. whole file edits:
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;J0-oYyozUZw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;J0-oYyozUZw</a><p>Building reliable code agents is hard. Beyond simple prototypes, any app with code generation in production quickly runs into two problems --  how do you reliably apply diffs, and how do you manage codebase context?<p>We&#x27;re focused on solving these two problems at order-of-magnitude lower price and latency.<p>Our first model that we released, in February, is the Fast Apply model -- it merges code snippets with files at 4300 tok&#x2F;s. It is more reliable (in terms of merge errors) than Sonnet, Qwen, Llama, or any other model at this task. Each file takes ~900ms and gives an instantaneous user experience, as well as saving ~40% on Claude 4 output tokens.<p>Our second model focuses on retrieval. For both vibe-coded and enterprise codebases, retrieving only the files relevant to a user request saves both on SoTA input token cost and reduces the number of times code agents need to view files. Our reranker (evals below) can scan a million-line codebase in ~1-2s, and our embedding model outperforms any other embedding model for retrieval as evaluated on a corpus of Typescript&#x2F;React repositories.<p>There are many different ways to build coding agents, but being able to edit code reliably and retrieve the most relevant parts of the codebase is going to be a foundational issue. We&#x27;re excited to be building ways to make it more accessible to millions of users who don&#x27;t want to spend $$$ on Claude.<p>These models are used in production, millions of times per week. If you&#x27;ve used Lovable, Create.xyz, Magic Patterns, Codebuff, Tempo Labs then you&#x27;ve used us!<p>Here&#x27;s a link to try it out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.relace.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.relace.ai</a>, and here are our docs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.relace.ai">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.relace.ai</a>.<p>We&#x27;ve opened up free access for prototyping on our website to everyone, and the limits should be enough for personal coding use and building small projects (correct us if it’s not). We integrate directly with Open-Source IDE&#x27;s like Continue.dev. Please try us out, we&#x27;d love to hear your feedback!

## 30. Every wondered how Facebook spoofs Gmail message list snippet text?

chrisjj:E.g. Gmail inbox shows a message contains &quot;XXX tagged you on Facebook. Take a look about what she said on you.&quot;<p>But when you open the message, there&#x27;s no &quot;Take a look about what she said on you.&quot;<p>Answer. The text is present but hidden:<p>&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:#FFFFFF;font-size:1px;opacity:0;&quot;&gt;Take a look at what she said about you.&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;<p>And unsurprisingly whenever I do click through, I find she hasn&#x27;t said anything about me.
