## 26. Show HN: A word of the day that doesn't suck

jsomers:I’ve long thought that the Word of the Day was a wasted genre. The goal should be to give you words you can use; to enrich your understanding of words you already know; or at least to use words to tell you something neat about the world.<p>Instead, what you usually get is words that will never be used in conversation, held up as curios. Some examples from Dictionary.com’s daily email: thewless, balladmonger, vagility, contextomy. These words are... not useful.<p>I’ve always thought I could do better. My friend Ben recently created a daily puzzle game, called Bracket City, launched here on HN [1], which I like because it takes about the same amount of time as Wordle but has some of the variety and artistry of a good crossword.<p>Ben agreed to let me write a word of the day for the game’s audience. We’ve collected them all here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bracket.city&#x2F;words" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bracket.city&#x2F;words</a>. It’s such a joy to write -- every day, I pay homage to a word I love or use or have newly discovered. I find myself paying more attention to words I encounter, thinking if they deserve a place.<p>It’s also fun for another reason. Many years ago I wrote a blog post, &quot;You’re probably using the wrong dictionary&quot; [2], that made the rounds and actually still finds new readers today. It was about how the modern-day dictionaries we find by default on our iPhones and web browsers are actually kind of bureaucratic and lifeless. Through a writer I love, John McPhee, I rediscovered Webster’s 1913 dictionary, which feels like it was written by a thinking person who loved words. I still consult it all the time. Writing a word of the day has reminded me just how delightful and useful Webster’s old dictionary is -- and reacquainted me with the OED, which I now look to every day, and which I discovered you can access with your library card.<p>Some of my favorite entries so far: sophisticated, twee, gravitas, blockbuster, meteorologist, send, bid. There are more than 175 now -- and more coming once a day, every day, for as long as Bracket City stands.<p>To sign up to see each word of the day as it’s published, go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bracket.city&#x2F;words" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bracket.city&#x2F;words</a>.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=43622719">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=43622719</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsomers.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;dictionary" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jsomers.net&#x2F;blog&#x2F;dictionary</a>

## 29. Show HN: Phind.design – Image editor & design tool powered by 4o / custom models

rushingcreek:Hi HN,<p>Today we’re launching phind.design (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design</a>), an image editor and design tool that uses 4o and custom models to allow users to generate and edit designs for anything from logos and advertisements to creative website and app designs.<p>4o is great at producing a first version of an image, but is not capable of editing it without messing up other parts of it. We fix this by running Flux Kontext alongside 4o image gen in the chat, as well as by introducing a precision editor powered by custom models where a user indicates an area to modify and we guarantee that only that area will be modified.<p>Our precision editor is state-of-the-art on image editing in our tests and allows inserting new additional images into the existing image. The latter allows users to insert a logo, product, or face into an image without messing up other parts of the image, and even fix logos and faces that were messed up by 4o. Text editing with the precision edit model is still a work in progress, and we will fix it with the next iteration of that model. We recommend using the chat for editing text for now.<p>Example: Insert UT Austin logo into helicopter ad (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design&#x2F;edit?chat=cmd27o2n10001l704h6865f3u" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design&#x2F;edit?chat=cmd27o2n10001l704h6865f3u</a>)<p>We also always produce multiple variations for image generations and edits, as we think this variety is important for getting exactly what you asked for.<p>Example: Paul Graham in startup heaven (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design&#x2F;edit?chat=cmd23h91c000jky04no5d92uy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design&#x2F;edit?chat=cmd23h91c000jky04no5d92uy</a>)<p>One thing we’re excited about is adding more variation into AI-generated websites, as many website builders all use the same CSS libraries, so many websites end up looking the same. 
We hope to allow builders and creatives to make truly unique designs in 1&#x2F;10th the time it currently takes with existing tools.<p>Example: Make me a popeyes landing page where the eyes are actually popping out (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design&#x2F;edit?chat=cmd25imtm0001jr046nsag4lu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design&#x2F;edit?chat=cmd25imtm0001jr046nsag4lu</a>)
Example: A train map with sandwich ingredients replacing subway stops. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design&#x2F;edit?chat=cmd23i98c0001ie04l56npyj3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phind.design&#x2F;edit?chat=cmd23i98c0001ie04l56npyj3</a>)<p>As engineers who have been frustrated by the time commitment it takes to learn Figma or Photoshop, we hope that phind.design makes it incredibly easy to go from zero to one on your wildest creative ideas.<p>The editor is far from perfect, particularly when it comes to text. We are working on it and have a new custom precision editing model on the way. In the meantime, we’re excited to hear your comments and feedback!
