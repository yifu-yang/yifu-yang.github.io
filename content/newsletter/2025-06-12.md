## 9. Show HN: Eyesite - experimental website combining computer vision and web design

akchro:I wanted Apple Vision Pros, but I don’t have $3,500 in my back pocket. So I made Apple Vision Pros at home.<p>This was just a fun little project I made. Currently, the website doesn&#x27;t work on screens less than 1200x728 (Sorry mobile users!) It also might struggle on lower end devices.<p>For best results, have a webcam pointing right at you. I tested my website with a MacBook camera.<p>Any comments, questions, or suggestions are greatly appreciated!<p>blog: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.andykhau.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;eyesite" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.andykhau.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;eyesite</a><p>check it out: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eyesite.andykhau.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eyesite.andykhau.com&#x2F;</a><p>github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;akchro&#x2F;eyesite">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;akchro&#x2F;eyesite</a>

kenrick95:Hi HN,<p>In the past ~8 months, I have been working on a side project that helps me plan my travels.

## 24. Show HN: RomM – An open-source, self-hosted ROM manager and player

gassi:RomM is a self-hosted app that allows you to manage your retro game files (ROMs) and play them in the browser.<p>Think of it as Plex or Jellyfin for your ROM library: it automatically fetches metadata, artwork, and game information from online metadata sources to transform your folders into a browsable collection.<p>You can play games directly in the browser for consoles like the N64, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, and PlayStation 1, using the integrated web emulator (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emulatorjs.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emulatorjs.org&#x2F;</a>). Members of the community have released integrations for Playnite (Windows), muOS (Anbernic handhelds) and Decky Loader (Steam Deck), with many more in the works.<p>The team has been working on RomM for just over two years now, and we&#x27;re incredibly proud of what we&#x27;ve built so far. There&#x27;s no company behind the project, just a bunch of friends building something together that we&#x27;ve wanted for a long time. And of course, the code is open-source and AGPLv3 licensed.<p>Check out the (kinda slow) demo running on an ultra-cheap VPS: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.romm.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.romm.app&#x2F;</a>
