## 19. Show HN: I'm an airline pilot – I built interactive graphs/globes of my flights

jamesharding:Hey HN!<p>Pilots everywhere are required to keep a logbook of all their flying hours, aircraft, airports, and so on. Since I track everything digitally (some people still just use paper logbooks!), I put together some data visualizations and a few 3D globes to show my flying history.<p>This globe is probably my favourite so far: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jameshard.ing&#x2F;pilot&#x2F;globes&#x2F;all" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jameshard.ing&#x2F;pilot&#x2F;globes&#x2F;all</a><p>If you’ve got ideas for other graphs or ways to show this kind of data, I’d love to hear them!

## 28. Show HN: AGL a toy language that compiles to Go

alain_gilbert:I spent the past 2 weeks making this toy programming language.<p>I basically forked the Go scanner&#x2F;parser, and changed the syntax to have functions return a single value. This enable proper Result&#x2F;Option type to be used as well as propagating errors with an operator.<p>I also wanted to have short &quot;type inferred&quot; anonymous functions to be able to use functions like Map&#x2F;Reduce&#x2F;Filter, without having to use 100 characters to specify the types.
