## 2. Show HN: MCP-Shield – Detect security issues in MCP servers

nick_wolf:I noticed the growing security concerns around MCP (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=43600192">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=43600192</a>) and built an open source tool that can detect several patterns of tool poisoning attacks, exfiltration channels and cross-origin manipulations.<p>MCP-Shield scans your installed servers (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.) and shows what each tool is trying to do at the instruction level, beyond just the API surface. It catches hidden instructions that try to read sensitive files, shadow other tools&#x27; behavior, or exfiltrate data.<p>Example of what it detects:<p>- Hidden instructions attempting to access ~&#x2F;.ssh&#x2F;id_rsa<p>- Cross-origin manipulations between server that can redirect WhatsApp messages<p>- Tool shadowing that overrides behavior of other MCP tools<p>- Potential exfiltration channels through optional parameters<p>I&#x27;ve included clear examples of detection outputs in the README and multiple example vulnerabilities in the repo so you can see the kinds of things it catches.<p>This is an early version, but I&#x27;d appreciate feedback from the community, especially around detection patterns and false positives.

## 15. Ask HN: Why is there no P2P streaming protocol like BitTorrent?

memet_rush:I&#x27;ve been wondering if anyone knows why there is no P2P protocol for mass live stream content in decent quality? specifically what are the technical limitations or is it mostly that people don&#x27;t want to get destroyed by media company lawyers? I&#x27;ve searched around for a while and i cant find anything like that that can handle thousands of people streaming. The closest is probably Webrtc and that looks like it can only handle 500~ peers.<p>I was thinking most people nowaday have at least 30mbps upload and a 1080p stream only needs ~10mbps and 720p needs ~5ish. Also i think it wouldnt have to be live, people would definitely not mind some amount of lag. I was thinking the big O for packets propagating out in the network should be Log(N) since if a master is sharing the content then is connected to 10 slaves, then those connected to 10 other slaves and so on.<p>The other limitation I could think of is prioritizing who gets the packets first since there&#x27;s a lot of people with 1gbs connections or &gt;10mbps connections. Also deprioritizing leechers to keep it from degrading the stream.<p>Does anyone have knowledge on why it isn&#x27;t a thing still though? it&#x27;s super easy to find streams on websites but they&#x27;re all 360p or barely load. I saw the original creator of bittorrent was creating something like this over 10 years ago and seems to be a dead project. Also this is ignoring the huge time commitment it would take to program something like this. I want to know if this is technically possible to have streams of lets say 100,000 people and why or why not.<p>Just some thoughts, thanks in advance!

## 16. Show HN: Portable Giant File Viewer

sunny41:I’ve been dealing with huge log files lately, several GBs in size, and got frustrated with common tools such as Notepad++ freezing and crashing a server with limited RAM. I wanted something fast, relatively lightweight, and install-free for Windows. I have been searched around the web for a while but couldn&#x27;t find an equivalent, so I built Giant Log Viewer.<p>Features:<p>- It is an equivalent of the Linux&#x27; `less` pager tool for Windows, but works on Linux and macOS too<p>- Opens multi-GB UTF-8 unstructured log&#x2F;text files instantly (without loading everything into memory)<p>- Navigates through the file using keyboard shortcuts -- jump to the end of the file, go to previous line, etc.<p>- Limited text&#x2F;regular expression searching<p>- Portable -- just unzip and run<p>- Open-source -- welcome to contribute or fork<p>Would love your feedback, and if it’s useful, feel free to star it, suggest improvements or even contribute! Depends on the needs of myself and other users, more features might be added.

## 24. Omnom: Self-hosted bookmarking with searchable, wysiwyg snapshots

mstef:a bit of background. this is a rewrite of omnom by asciimoo - the guy who also made searx. originally i wrote omnom, back in the days when del.icio.us was enshittified and gone down the drain. instead of complaining i was taking the opportunity to write a replacement that i would want, it became omnom, and for many years me and a bunch of users were very happy with it.<p>but the fast moving world of browser extensions made maintenance (for a non-commercial free software side project) too expensive, so the extension support became erratic, until it died completely. for a year or two i didn&#x27;t use it.<p>but then asked asciimo if he could have a look a the extensions (since he was recently working on another extension, so had some experience), he looked at it, and rewrote the whole thing in go and fixed the extension. he even got support from nlnet&#x2F;ngi0.<p>if you want to have your own self-hosted libre software bookmarking service for you and your community, give it a go, it&#x27;s very simple, privacy respecting and most robust when it comes to snapshotting. asciimoo did a great job.
