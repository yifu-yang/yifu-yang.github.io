## 11. Show HN: I'm a teacher and built an AI presentation tool

slidehero:Hi,
I&#x27;m a high school teacher from Australia and I&#x27;ve built what I&#x27;d like to think is a pretty nifty ChatGPT powered presentation tool for teachers.<p>I&#x27;d love it if you could have a look at it and give me some of your feedback.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much overlap with the HN crowd and school teachers, but I&#x27;ve been coming here for many years and thought I&#x27;d post here and see what you all think.<p>Check it out if you have a minute and I&#x27;d be super happy to hear your feedback too.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slidehero.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slidehero.ai&#x2F;</a><p>You can jump in and have a play with the tool all you like ;)<p>Cheers, Eli

## 30. Show HN: LinkedIn sucks, so I built a better one

fliellerjulian:LinkedIn feels more like Facebook every day — noisy feeds, fake engagement, and everyone shouting into the void.<p>Thats why I used to built a personal microsite on Squarespace and uploaded a video resume to YouTube to stand out - it helped me land interviews and get into Big Tech.<p>But I always wondered: why isn’t there a platform designed to help you stand out like that?<p>So I built OpenSpot: a public, curated platform where you can showcase who you are — with video, audio, and proof of your work. No endless feeds. No humblebrags. Just real people open to new opportunities.<p>We’ve already onboarded a few companies, so recruiters can reach out to you directly. But you can also connect with other standout folks and supercharge your network.<p>Just upload your resume and we´ll automatically generate your profile in under 1 minute.<p>It’s early, but feels like something people actually need.
Would love your thoughts.
