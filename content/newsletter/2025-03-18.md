## 12. Show HN: OpenTimes – Free travel times between U.S. Census geographies

dfsnow:Hi HN! Today I&#x27;m launching OpenTimes, a free database of roughly 150 billion pre-computed, point-to-point travel times between United States Census geographies. In addition to letting you visualize travel isochrones on the homepage, OpenTimes also lets you download massive amounts of travel time data for free and with no limits.<p>The primary goal here is to enable research and fill a gap I noticed in the open-source spatial ecosystem. Researchers (social scientists, economists, etc.) use large travel time matrices to quantify things like access to healthcare, but they often end up paying Google or Esri for the necessary data. By pre-calculating times between commonly-used research geographies (i.e. Census) and then making those times easily accessible via SQL, I hope to make large-scale accessibility research cheaper and simpler.<p>Some technical bits that may be of interest to HN folks:<p>- The entire OpenTimes backend is just static Parquet files on R2. There&#x27;s no RDBMS or running service. The whole thing costs about $10&#x2F;month to host and is free to serve.<p>- All travel times were calculated by pre-building the inputs (OSM, OSRM networks) and then distributing the compute over hundreds of GitHub Actions jobs.<p>- The query&#x2F;SQL layer uses a setup I haven&#x27;t seen before: a single DuckDB database file with views that point to static Parquet files via HTTP.<p>Finally, the driving times are optimistic since they don&#x27;t (yet) account for traffic. This is something I hope to work on in the near future. Enjoy!

## 25. Show HN: Cascii – A portable ASCII diagram builder written in vanilla JavaScript

ftr1200:3 months ago I wanted to draw an ASCII diagram to include in some documentation at work. I found the few tools online to be insufficient, and was suprised there wasn&#x27;t a more complete tool to get the job done.<p>Since, I&#x27;ve built Cascii from scratch in vanilla Javascript (I&#x27;m not an FE dev, it might be obvious...).<p>I hope it works alright. Please check out the live version at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cascii.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cascii.app</a>, report problems, make diagrams to improve your code&#x27;s documentation. Hope you enjoy using it.

## 28. Show HN: Psychedelic animation generator; (p)art of your next trip

getToTheChopin:Sharing an open source project for creating psychadelic art -- using liquid motion, distorted shapes, shadows and light. This tool works in real-time in the browser using webgl shaders.<p>This project was inspired by drum &amp; bass &#x2F; acid techno music, and 90s rave posters.<p>Use this to create art for a music video, concert posters, stylized animations in creative projects, or simply to enjoy alongside some fine music.<p>Use the detailed control menu (top-right) to set a custom canvas size, adjust animation speed, control pattern and colours, etc...<p>You can export your creation as an image or video afterwards.<p>How this works: this tool uses WebGL shaders to create a real-time animation (with a trippy liquid &#x2F; shadow &#x2F; blur aesthetic).<p>The animation is created using a random seed position and mixes in random noise (fractal brownian motion, 3D simplex noise), so each time you re-run it you&#x27;re creating a unique piece of art.<p>Github repo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;collidingScopes&#x2F;liquid-shape-distortions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;collidingScopes&#x2F;liquid-shape-distortions</a><p>-----<p>I hope you enjoy the visuals. I&#x27;d love to hear any feedback or suggestions.
