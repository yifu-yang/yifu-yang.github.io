## 2. Show HN: My from-scratch OS kernel that runs DOOM

UnmappedStack:Hi there! I&#x27;ve been on-and-off working on TacOS for a few months, which follows some UNIX-derived concepts (exec&#x2F;fork, unix-style VFS, etc) and is now able to run a port of Doom, with a fairly small amount of modifications, using my from-scratch libc. The performance is actually decent compared to what I expected. Very interested to hear your thoughts. Thank you!

## 9. Launch HN: Cua (YC X25) – Open-Source Docker Container for Computer-Use Agents

frabonacci:Hey HN, we’re Francesco and Alessandro, the creators of c&#x2F;ua (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trycua.com">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trycua.com</a>), a Docker‑style container runtime that lets AI agents drive full operating systems in lightweight, isolated VMs. Our entire framework is open‑source (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trycua&#x2F;cua">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trycua&#x2F;cua</a>), and today we’re thrilled to have our Launch HN!<p>Check out our demo to see it in action: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ee9qf-13gho" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ee9qf-13gho</a>, and for more examples - including Tableau, Photoshop, CAD workflows - see the demos in our repo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trycua&#x2F;cua">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trycua&#x2F;cua</a>.<p>For Computer-Use AI agents to be genuinely useful, they must interact with your system&#x27;s native applications. But giving full access to your host device is risky. What if the agent&#x27;s process gets compromised, or the LLM hallucinates and leaks your data? And practically speaking, do you really want to give up control of your entire machine just so the agent can do its job?<p>The idea behind c&#x2F;ua is simple: let agents operate in a mirror of the user’s system - isolated, secure, and disposable - so users can fire-and-forget complex tasks without needing to dedicate their entire system to the agent. By running in a virtualized environment, agents can carry out their work without interrupting your workflow or risking the integrity of your system.<p>While exploring this idea, I discovered Apple’s Virtualization.Framework and realized it offered fast and lightweight virtualization on Apple Silicon. This led us to build a high-performance virtualization layer and, eventually, a computer-use interface that allows agents to interact with apps just like a human would - without taking over the entire system.<p>As we built this, we decided to open-source the virtualization core as a standalone CLI tool called Lume (Show HN here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42908061">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=42908061</a>). c&#x2F;ua builds on top of Lume, providing a full framework for running agent workflows inside secure macOS or Linux VMs, so your system stays free for you to use while the agent works its magic in the background.<p>With Cua you can build an AI agent within a virtual environment to: - navigate and interact with any application&#x27;s interface; - read screen content and perform keyboard&#x2F;mouse actions; - switch between applications and self-debug when needed; - operate in a secure sandbox with controlled file access. All of this occurs in a fully isolated environment, ensuring your host system, files, and sensitive data remain completely secure, while you continue using your device without interruption.<p>People are using c&#x2F;ua to: - Bypass CryptoJS-based encryption and anti-bot measures to interact with modern web apps reliably; - Automate Tableau dashboards and export insights via Claude Desktop; - Drive Photoshop for batch image editing by prompt; - Modify 3D models in Fusion 360 with a CAD Copilot; -Extract data from legacy ERP apps without brittle screen‑scraping scripts.<p>We’re currently working on multi‑VM orchestration for parallel agentic workflows, Windows and Linux VM support, and episodic and long-term memory for CUA Agents.<p>On the open‑source side, c&#x2F;ua is 100 % free under the MIT license - run it locally with any LLM you like. We’re also gearing up a hosted orchestration service for teams who want zero‑ops setup (early access sign‑ups opening soon).<p>We’d love to hear from you. What desktop or legacy apps do you wish you could automate? Any thoughts, feedback, or horror stories from fragile AI automations are more than welcome!

## 16. Show HN: Node.js video tutorials where you can edit and run the code

somebee:Hey HN,<p>I&#x27;m Sindre, CTO of Scrimba (YC S20). We originally launched Scrimba to make video learning more interactive for aspiring frontend developers. So instead of passively watching videos, you can jump in an experiment with the code directly inside the video player. Since launch, almost two million people have used Scrimba to grow their skills.<p>However, one limitation is that we&#x27;ve only supported frontend code, as our interactive videos run in the browser, whereas most of our learners want to go fullstack—building APIs, handling auth, working with databases, and so forth.<p>To fix this, we spent the last 6 months integrating StackBlitz WebContainers into Scrimba. This enables a full Node.js environment—including a terminal, shell, npm access, and a virtual file system—directly inside our video player. Everything runs in the browser.<p>Here is a 2-minute recorded demo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrimba.com&#x2F;s08dpq3nom">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrimba.com&#x2F;s08dpq3nom</a><p>If you want to see more, feel free to enroll into any of the seven fullstack courses we&#x27;ve launched so far, on subject like Node, Next, Express, SQL, Vite, and more. We&#x27;ve opened them up for Hacker News today so that you don&#x27;t even need to create an account to watch the content:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrimba.com&#x2F;fullstack">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrimba.com&#x2F;fullstack</a><p><i>Other notable highlights about our &quot;IDE videos&quot;:</i><p>- Based on events (code edits, cursor moves, etc) instead of pixels<p>- Roughly 100x smaller than traditional videos<p>- Recording is simple: just talk while you code<p>- Can be embedded in blogs, docs, or courses, like MDN does here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;curriculum&#x2F;core&#x2F;css-fundamentals&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;curriculum&#x2F;core&#x2F;css-fund...</a><p>- Entirely built in Imba, a language I created myself: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28207662">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28207662</a><p>We think this format could be useful for open-source maintainers and API-focused teams looking to create interactive docs or walkthroughs. Our videos are already embedded by MDN, LangChain, and Coursera.<p>If you maintain a library or SDK and want an interactive video about it, let us know—happy to record one for free that you can use however you like.<p>Would love to answer any questions or hear people&#x27;s feedback!
