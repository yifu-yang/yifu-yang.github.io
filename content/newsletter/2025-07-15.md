## 5. Show HN: CallFS – S3-style object store in one Go binary (MIT)

ebogdum:We started CallFS after yet another late-night “why did the uploads vanish?” incident. Our small team had stitched together rsync, a fragile NFS mount, and an S3 bucket—none of it observable, all of it waiting to bite us.<p>So we wrote a single-process file service in Go that:
• Speaks the S3 API (so existing tooling works).
• Stores hot data on local disks for speed; cold data can sit in any S3-compatible bucket.
• Exposes Prometheus metrics and JSON logs by default, because “what happened?” shouldn’t be guesswork.
• Ships as a ~25 MB static binary—no external deps, MIT license.<p>Today it’s stable for single-node or side-by-side deployments. Clustering is on the roadmap, replication will follow, but we wanted to share the code early and hear real-world pain points. If storage glue code ever ruined your weekend, we’d love feedback and PRs.

## 9. Context Rot: How increasing input tokens impacts LLM performance

kellyhongsn:I work on research at Chroma, and I just published our latest technical report on context rot.<p>TLDR: Model performance is non-uniform across context lengths, including state-of-the-art GPT-4.1, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, and Qwen3 models.<p>This highlights the need for context engineering. Whether relevant information is present in a model’s context is not all that matters; what matters more is how that information is presented.<p>Here is the complete open-source codebase to replicate our results: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chroma-core&#x2F;context-rot">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chroma-core&#x2F;context-rot</a>

## 13. Show HN: Bedrock – An 8-bit computing system for running programs anywhere

benbridle:Hey everyone, this is my latest project.<p>Bedrock is a lightweight program runtime: programs assemble down to a few kilobytes of bytecode that can run on any computer, console, or handheld. The runtime is tiny, it can be implemented from scratch in a few hours, and the I&#x2F;O devices for accessing the keyboard, screen, networking, etc. can be added on as needed.<p>I designed Bedrock to make it easier to maintain programs as a solo developer. It&#x27;s deeply inspired by Uxn and PICO-8, but it makes significant departures from Uxn to provide more capabilities to programs and to be easier to implement.<p>Let me know if you try it out or have any questions.

## 16. Show HN: VS Code extension to edit the filesystem like a text buffer

hexomancer:This is a spiritual adaptation of oil.nvim for vscode. The main idea is you edit the filesystem by editing the current directory listing&#x27;s text buffer. For example, if I want to rename a file, I just rename it in the listing file. This is extremely powerful because it translates all of your text-editing skills immediately into file editing capabilities.<p>Some features:<p>* Create&#x2F;rename&#x2F;move&#x2F;delete files by editing the current directory listing&#x27;s textbuffer<p>* Filter using glob pattern<p>* Trash and undo support<p>* Works even in remote-ssh workspaces<p>* Works across multiple vscode windows
