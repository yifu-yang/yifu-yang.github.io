## 7. Show HN: DrawDB – open-source online database diagram editor (a retro)

1ilit:One year ago I open-sourced my very first &#x27;real&#x27; project and shared it here. I was a college student in my senior year and desperately looking for a job. At the time of sharing it i couldn&#x27;t even afford a domain and naively let someone buy the one i had my eyes on lol. It&#x27;s been a hell of a year with this blowing up, me moving to another country, and switching 2 jobs.<p>In a year we somehow managed to hit 26k stars, grow a 1000+ person discord community, and support 37 languages. I couldn&#x27;t be more grateful for the community that helped this grow, but now i don&#x27;t know what direction to take this project in.<p>All of this was an accident. But now I feel like I&#x27;m missing out on not using this success. I have been thinking of monetization options, but not sure if I wanna go down that route. I like the idea of it being free and available for everyone but also can&#x27;t help but think of everything that could be done if committed full-time or even had a small team. I keep telling myself(and others) i&#x27;ll do something if i meet a co-founder, but doubt and fear of blowing this up keeps back.<p>How would you proceed?

davidkuennen:Today, I noticed that my behavior has shifted over the past few months. Right now, I exclusively use ChatGPT for any kind of search or question.<p>Using Google now feels completely lackluster in comparison.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed the same thing happening in my circle of friends as well—and they don’t even have a technical background.<p>How about you?

## 29. Show HN: Coroot – eBPF-based, open source observability with actionable insights

openWrangler:A common open source approach to observability will begin with databases and visualizations for telemetry - Grafana, Prometheus, Jaeger. But observability doesn’t begin and end here: these tools require configuration, dashboard customization, and may not actually pinpoint the data you need to mitigate system risks.<p>Coroot was designed to solve the problem of manual, time-consuming observability analysis: it handles the full observability journey — from collecting telemetry to turning it into actionable insights. We also strongly believe that simple observability should be an innovation everyone can benefit from: which is why our software is open source.<p>Features:<p>- Cost monitoring to track and minimise your cloud expenses (AWS, GCP, Azure.)<p>- SLO tracking with alerts to detect anomalies and compare them to your system’s baseline behaviour.<p>- 1-click application profiling: see the exact line of code that caused an anomaly.<p>- Mapped timeframes (stop digging through Grafana to find when the incident occurred.)<p>- eBPF automatically gathers logs, metrics, traces, and profiles for you.<p>- Service map to grasp a complete at-a-glance picture of your system.<p>- Automatic discovery and monitoring of every application deployment in your kubernetes cluster.<p>We welcome any feedback and hope the tool can improve your workflow!
