## 12. Show HN: Codigo – The Programming Language Repository

adamjhf:Codigo is a site I&#x27;ve built for discovering, exploring and comparing programming languages, including language news, trends and code examples.<p>I couldn&#x27;t find any definitive resource for finding new languages and comparing them, so decided to make one.<p>It combines dynamic data from sources like PyPL Index, TIOBE Index and official feeds as well as static data about each language defined in a structured format. The language data is open-contribution and can be updated by anyone on the GitHub repository: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codigo-langs&#x2F;codigo">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;codigo-langs&#x2F;codigo</a>.<p>I styled it specifically for coders - using a monospaced font and terminal-esque styling, along with many common IDE themes to choose from.<p>Codigo is built using Rust, Axum, HTMX and Alpine.js.<p>Keen to hear any feedback!

## 29. Show HN: Translate between dialects and share SQL queries on the browser

WhyIsItAlwaysHN:Last year, I wanted to learn a bit about how easy it would be to deploy a python app via web assembly to the browser and decided to make a wrapper around the amazing sqlglot by Toby Mao and the rest of the team.<p>The tool lets you paste in Sql queries and translate them between the available sql dialects in sqlglot. It also gives you parse diagnostics and the ability to easily share queries via storing all the state in the url.<p>The stack that was used is typescript for the UI and pyodide to integrate with Sqlglot, which does the heavy lifting.<p>It&#x27;s more of a toy app but I&#x27;ve found some use out of it, so I&#x27;m sharing it in case anyone finds it useful too.<p>Future plans are to add some statistics on the queries like number of joins, to add the ability to define a schema and also adding support for executing toy queries.
